<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Central Europe: Enemies, Neighbors, Friends</h2><p>Throughout the Cold War era, the Iron Curtain divided Central Europe into a Communist East and a democratic West, and we grew accustomed to looking at this part of the world in bipolar ideological terms. Yet many people living on both sides of the Iron Curtain considered themselves Central Europeans, and the idea of Central Europe was one of the driving forces behind the revolutionary year of 1989 as well as the deterioration of Yugoslavia and its ensuing wars.<br> <em>Central Europe</em> provides a broad overview and comparative analysis of key events in a historical region that encompasses contemporary Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, and Croatia. Starting with the initial conversion of the "pagan" peoples of the region to Christianity around 1000 A.D. and concluding with the revolutions of 1989 and the problems of post-Communist states today, it illuminates the distinctive nature and peculiarities of the historical development of this region as a cohesive whole. Lonnie R. Johnson introduces readers to Central Europe's heritage of diversity, the interplay of its cultures, and the origins of its malicious ethnic and national conflicts. History in Central Europe, he shows, has been epic and tragic. Throughout the ages, small nations struggled valiantly against a series of imperial powers--Ottoman Turkey, Habsburg Austria, imperial Germany, czarist Russia, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union--and they lost regularly. Johnson's account is present-minded in the best sense: in describing actual historical events, he illustrates the ways they have been remembered, and how they contribute to the national assumptions that still drive European politics today. Indeed, the constant interplay of reality and myth--the processes of myth-making and remembrance--animates much of this history. <br> Since the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, the unanticipated problems of transforming post-Communist states into democracies with market economies, the wars in the former Yugoslavia, and the challenges of European integration have all made Central Europe the most dynamic and troubled region in Europe. In <em>Central Europe</em>, Johnson combines a vivid and panoramic narrative of events, a nuanced analysis of social, economic, and political developments, and a thoughtful portrait of those myths and memories that have lives of their own--and consequences for all of Europe.<br></p><p>Central Europe provides a broad overview and comparative analysis of key events in a historical region that encompasses contemporary Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, and Croatia.

If you were their manager, your challenge would be to help each individual find an effective, timely solution to the problem. Most managers would do what comes naturally and use the managerial style that is their "first dimension." This will work some of the time - but not all the time.<br> One managerial style can't help people with four different working styles make the most of their different strengths and overcome their different limitations and roadblocks. In managing others, one style does not fit all. The 4-Dimensional Manager will help you learn to manage different people in the best ways. Through a simple yet powerful self-discovery tool called DiSC, you can become a 4-dimensional manager, able to manage anyone, anywhere, anytime.<br> Discover your usual managerial style: Dominance, Influence, Supportiveness, or Conscientiousness<br> Read the work styles of the people you manage<br> Improve communication and reduce destructive conflict<br> Find out how the style of your organization affects you and those you manage<br> Whether or not you have the formal title of manager, if you provide work direction to others, this book will answer pressing questions you have every day, such as:<br> When I delegate, how much information should I give, and when and how should I follow up?<br> How can I increase this person's motivation?<br> What kind of compliment or reward would this person most value?<br> How can I give feedback so it will be understood, accepted, and effective?<br> The 4-Dimensional Manager provides fascinating insights into individual work styles, practical suggestions, checklists and planners, and a research-based DiSC discovery tool.</p><p>Julie Straw is Vice President of Training and Communications for Inscape Publishing, the world�s leading independent developer and publisher of research-based personal learning profiles for business.

She was also on the writing faculty of the New School and lectured widely on writing, women writers, women's issues, and cultural history. Among her best-known works are <em>Aline </em>and <em>Gramercy Park</em>.</p>When the prolific, multifaceted novelist Lessing (Ben; In the World; etc.) heard that several biographies of her were in the works, she wroteA"in self-defense"Atwo well-received books covering her first four decades before this first, disappointing biography could be published. In her own books, Lessing captured the more colorful and exuberant parts of her life: her childhood in Southern Rhodesia, her rebellious adolescence, her two unsuccessful marriages, her anticolonial political radicalism, her affiliation with the Communist Party and her literary debut in London's bohemian, intellectual circles. Klein (Aline; Gramercy Park), after a pallid paraphrased account of Lessing's version, is left to assemble other, less satisfactory sources on the remaining years, which cover Lessing's writings after The Golden Notebook, her experiments with radical psychology and her conversion to Sufism. Klein's interviews with Lessing's ex-friends and former colleagues are largely anonymousAand often filled with memories of her aloofness, irritability or vulnerability. Some are willing to go on record, such as Clancy Sigal, who was, at least in his own opinion, the great love of her life; Klein similarly takes full advantage of Lessing's correspondence with editor Robert Gottlieb. Otherwise, she depends on material from Lessing's previously published interviews and her often autobiographical fiction and nonfiction. Klein's psychological analysis of her subject lags after Lessing's own, without the irony and wit, and her striving for an objective viewpoint results, often, in merely noting Lessing's inconsistencies. Lessing entitled the first volume of her autobiography Under My SkinAwhich is where, for all Klein's research despite Lessing's disapproval, this biography never gets.

Wells invented the myth of invasion from outer space. Martians land near London, conquering all before them and destroying the metropolis: the fate of civilization remains in doubt until the final pages. Disturbingly realistic and peopled with believable characters, the novel exemplifies the mixture of scientific scepticism and vivid imagination that made Wells the father of modern science fiction.</p><p>This is the granddaddy of all alien invasion stories, first published by H.G. Wells in 1898. The novel begins ominously, as the lone voice of a narrator tells readers that "No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's..." <p> Things then progress from a series of seemingly mundane reports about odd atmospheric disturbances taking place on Mars to the arrival of Martians just outside of London. At first the Martians seem laughable, hardly able to move in Earth's comparatively heavy gravity even enough to raise themselves out of the pit created when their spaceship landed. But soon the Martians reveal their true nature as death machines 100-feet tall rise up from the pit and begin laying waste to the surrounding land. Wells quickly moves the story from the countryside to the evacuation of London itself and the loss of all hope as England's military suffers defeat after defeat. With horror his narrator describes how the Martians suck the blood from living humans for sustenance, and how it's clear that man is not being conquered so much a corralled. <i>--Craig E.

David Galloway&#39;s Introduction reveals Poe not only as a complex personality and one of America&#39;s most exotic writers, but also as an individual who engaged in an astonishing variety of interests.</p><p>Edgar Allan Poe (1809 - 49), was born in Boston, USA. He was a short-story writer, editor and literary critic, and is considered part of the American Romantic Movement. Best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre, Poe was one of the earliest American practitioners of the short story and is considered the inventor the detective-fiction genre.A fine collection of Poe&#39;s stories are selected here. Andrew Sachs does an excellent job of presenting each. He maintains the fine air of detachment at the beginning of each tale. Then, as each tale unfolds, he draws us in as Poe intended, making the full effect unsettling and in several cases chilling. Sachs speaks clearly and chooses few characterizations in the stories. There are numerous more dramatized readings of Poe&#39;s stories, but Sachs&#39;s straight-forward, intelligent presentation is an excellent choice for listeners who want unadorned narrative. R.F.W.

Organized into three categories--``Farmers,'' ``Workers,'' ``Domestic Servants''- -the letters selected were written by 20 different individuals or families, each contributing several letters over a course of years. The correspondents offer an intimate look at immigrant triumphs and troubles (most often about money, especially falling into debt, or about bad health: as Christian Lenz writes in 1849 from Tennessee to his brother in Germany, ``here there's no fear of war, what the sword is for you is here the Korlra [cholera]...Here the sickness is so common that in the big cities half the people have been buried'')--as well as fresh eyewitness descriptions of America (``Dear Marie,'' writes Wilhelmine Wiebusch in 1884 from Brooklyn to her overseas mother, ``you really ought to see New York...the most beautiful and main street, Broadway, is more than 6 hours long...Crossing the street is positively dangerous, one wagon after the next, so loud you can't hear yourself talk, business and money everywhere''). Expertly translated by Vogel, with intensively researched introductions and annotations by the editors, this is a vital and captivating contribution to immigrant lore. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Several of these radio talks have been selected and edited by Mark Watts, Alan&#39;s oldest son, to introduce a new generation to Zen and the Beat Way. Through this collection we see influences of D.T. Suzuki, C.G. Jung, Gary Snyder and others. Specific chapters discuss Zen influences on traditional Japanese and Chinese arts and explores the celebrated concept of the &#34;controlled accident&#34; within the rich tradition of Zen aesthetics. Also included is &#34;Return to the Forest, &#34; an essay that explores the works of Joseph Campbell on the earliest Beat traditions.</p><p></p><h2>Workbook to Accompany Telling the Story: The Convergence of Print, Broadcast and Online Media</h2><p><p>Offers a wide variety of assignments dealing with all forms of media.

Amid cold war politics and civil rights protest, four of America&#x2019;s most incisive writers explored the gulf between remembrance and reality. Robert Penn Warren, the southern-reared poet-novelist who recanted his support of segregation; Bruce Catton, the journalist and U.S. Navy officer who became a popular Civil War historian; Edmund Wilson, the century&#x2019;s preeminent literary critic; and James Baldwin, the searing African-American essayist and activist&#x2015;each exposed America&#x2019;s triumphalist memory of the war. And each, in his own way, demanded a reckoning with the tragic consequences it spawned.</p><p>Blight illuminates not only mid-twentieth-century America&#x2019;s sense of itself but also the dynamic, ever-changing nature of Civil War memory. On the eve of the 150th anniversary of the war, we have an invaluable perspective on how this conflict continues to shape the country&#x2019;s political debates, national identity, and sense of purpose.</p></p><p>David W. Blight is Class of 1954 Professor of History at Yale University.&#x201c;The ghosts of the Civil War never leave us, as David Blight knows perhaps better than anyone, and in this superb book he masterfully unites two distant but inextricably bound events with insightful dissection of the works of four of our best writers, writers obsessed with coming to terms with our original sin.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ken Burns</b><br><br>&#x201c;David Blight has written a searching and suggestive book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Andrew Delbanco</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This book is several things, suggests Blight, but he hits it best when he characterizes it as a &#x2018;discussion of four Americans in search of their country&#x2019;s history.&#x2019; In doing so, he gives us more than a history lesson: he presents an introspective journey into America&#x2019;s most complex and enigmatic historical event through the minds of four exceptional storytellers. He offers us the opportunity to revisit a monumental tragedy and thereby invites us to probe its meaning. If we do, we will not only be reacquainted with a defining American moment but we will also learn more about who America is, and why.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James T. Crouse</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;David W. Blight&#x2019;s richly interpretive <i>American Oracle</i> contextualizes the sentimentalized celebration of the Civil War in the early 1960s within the tense realities of the civil rights era and the Cold War. Blight unravels the complexities of Civil War memory and meaning at a time when most white Americans considered restoration of the Union, not emancipation, as the war&#x2019;s grand result.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John David Smith</b><b>, </b><b><i>Charlotte Observer</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;As the sesquicentennial of the Civil War (2011&#x2013;15) begins, historian Blight examines how we handled the centennial, which occurred at the infancy of the civil rights movement, and the persistent questioning about all the elements that were at the heart of the nation-rending civil conflict. History and great literature blend beautifully as Blight conducts his examination of the works of four writers&#x2015;Robert Penn Warren, southern-born novelist; Bruce Catton, historian and journalist; Edmund Wilson, literary critic; and James Baldwin, northern-born essayist and race critic&#x2015;providing background and context for their works and their views of the centennial and all its commercialism and hypocrisy. From their different perspectives, the four offer &#x2018;a way of understanding the Civil War both as something very American and as an event in a larger human drama.&#x2019; Blight explores Warren&#x2019;s straightforward look at the racism at the heart of the war and the continued hypocrisy of southern commemorations, Catton&#x2019;s cold-eyed examination of the cost of war, Wilson&#x2019;s deconstruction of the war as a unifier of the nation, and Baldwin&#x2019;s chastisement of American racism. Throughout, Blight explores the mythology that came out of the Civil War and the sense of American redemption that did not include any examination of the tragedies of racism and slavery.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Vanessa Bush</b><b>, </b><b><i>Booklist (starred review)</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Overall a valuable contribution to historical understanding.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>D.

As we begin to contemplate the possibility of intervening in the human genome to prevent diseases, we cannot help but feel that the human species might soon be able to take its biological evolution in its own hands. 'Playing God' is the metaphor commonly used for this self-transformation of the species, which, it seems, might soon be within our grasp.<br>In this important new book, Jurgen Habermas - the most influential philosopher and social thinker in Germany today - takes up the question of genetic engineering and its ethical implications and subjects it to careful philosophical scrutiny. His analysis is guided by the view that genetic manipulation is bound up with the identity and self-understanding of the species. We cannot rule out the possibility that knowledge of one's own hereditary factors may prove to be restrictive for the choice of an individual's way of life and may undermine the symmetrical relations between free and equal human beings.<br>In the concluding chapter - which was delivered as a lecture on receiving the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade for 2001 - Habermas broadens the discussion to examine the tension between science and religion in the modern world, a tension which exploded, with such tragic violence, on September 11th.</p><p><b>J�rgen Habermas</b> is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Frankfurt.

A zealous advocate for the small investor for more than fifty years, Bogle has championed the restoration of integrity in industry practices. As an astute observer and commentator, he knows that a trustworthy business and financial complex is essential to America&#x2019;s continuing leadership in the world and to social and economic progress at home.<br>This book tells not just a story about what went wrong but, more important, the story of why we lost our way and of how we can right our course. Bogle argues for a return to a governance structure in which owners&#x2019; capital that has been put at risk is used in their interests rather than in the interests of corporate and financial managers. Given that ownership is now consolidated in the hands of relatively few large mutual and pension funds, the specific reforms Bogle details in this book are essential as well as practical. Every investor, analyst, Wall-Streeter, policy maker, and businessperson should read this deeply informed book.</p><p>Q: You say that individual investors have paid a heavy price for the abuses that occurred within the corporate, investment and mutual fund communities during the past few years. In what ways?<p></p><i>A: Individual investors have incurred high losses by paying excessive costs for executive compensation and purchasing overpriced stocks from option-enriched executives and entrepreneurs. Investors have also sacrificed returns by paying excessive management and marketing fees to funds that have delivered market-inferior returns. These costs can deprive investors of as much as 75 percent of the potential longterm returns available in the stock market simply by owning an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund.<p></p></i>Q: Despite the problems you point to in the book, you remain optimistic about the future. What are some of the things that make you hopeful?<p></p><i>A: Progressive public policy has begun to move toward the creation of a better world for investors, with laws and regulations designed to enhance the accuracy of financial statements, to increase the responsibilities of directors, and to give owners opportunities to ensure that their interests are served. However, the greatest reforms will come when an even better educated and informed investing public takes action in its own enlightened self interest.<p></p></i>Q: If you were to distill your book down to a few key messages, what would those be?<p></p><i>A: It is time to abandon the managers&#x2019; capitalism that has shaken our society&#x2019;s belief in the fairness of the system and return to the owners&#x2019; capitalism that built our nation. We need to build independent boards of directors who will provide prudent stewardship of the assets of the owners. We need the new controlling stockholders of corporate America the mutual and pension funds to act responsibly and solely in the interests of their investors. We need to create far more efficient systems for retirement savings that assure investors and beneficiaries of their fair share of market returns. To begin these tasks, we need to form an independent federal commission to evaluate our new agency society, with a view toward restoring fiduciary duty and trust as its objective.<p></p></i><b>John C.

Everyone can play a part in variable star observations, using a small telescope, binoculars, or even the naked eye. Written by an award-winning astronomer, Observing Variable Stars provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of variable star observation for the amateur. The book begins with advice on binoculars and telescopes, and on how and when to observe stars effectively. Levy then explains the ways in which to interpret variation in light output in terms of the life of a star, from birth to sometimes violent death. All the major variables are described and classified, as well as other variable objects such as active galaxies, asteroids, comets, and the sun. The book also illustrates how astrophysicists interpret variations in light output in terms of the evolution of stars. Observing Variable Stars contains a seasonal guide to the night sky usable in all latitudes. Throughout, practical observations serve to complement the text, making this an enjoyable, readable introduction to an exciting area of astronomy.</p><p>Observation of variable stars is an area where anyone can make a contribution to science, and is a fascinating activity using a small telescope or even a pair of binoculars.

With the first phase of construction completed, the garden opened to visitors in early 2008. It resembles those created in seventeenth-century Suzhou, offering awe-inspiring views and architecture and evoking an era when scholars sought quiet, intimate gardens in which to retreat, write poetry, and practice calligraphy, among many other pursuits. The contributors to <i>Another World Lies Beyond </i>discuss the challenges of constructing the garden in Southern California as well as the cultural traditions and aesthetics of Chinese garden design, especially the ways in which the plants and structures engage the imagination of visitors. Inscribed poetic couplets, literary allusions, botanical motifs, and evocative names for structures reveal layers of symbolism for exploration and interpretation. The volume's final essay describes how plants that originated in China&#x2014;such as the chrysanthemum, the plum, and the camellia&#x2014;have shaped that country's ancient botanical heritage and have enriched the gardens of both East and West.</p><p><b>T.

Authors Ritchey and Axelrod suggest that instead they should learn to see situations in new ways and create new options for themselves and others. That process begins with DiSC, an assessment tool that reveals what style one typically uses: Dominance (direct and decisive), Influence (optimistic and outgoing), Supportive (sympathetic and accommodating), and Conscientious (concerned and correct).<br><br> This book teaches readers how to recognize their own style and its implications, how to read the style of others, and how to choose the most effective style (or combination of styles) for any situation. I&#x2019;m Stuck, You&#x2019;re Stuck will help readers better understand why they and other people do the things they do in difficult situations and learn to respond to these situations mindfully, respectfully, and effectively.</p><p>Tom Ritchey is Chief Learning Officer of Inscape Publishing, developer of the original DiSC instrument, the Personal Profile System�. He has conducted hundreds of seminars and workshops on interpersonal skills, communication, and teamwork for a wide variety of education and business organizations, nationally and internationally.<br> Alan Axelrod is author of numerous business, communication, and management books, including the bestsellers Patton on Leadership and Elizabeth I C.E.O.Behaviors, as many industrial psychologists have emphasized for years, are infinitely easier to change than attitudes and personalities. What Ritchey recommends is the adoption of DiSC, an easy-to-administer (and diagnose) guide that, first, defines four distinct behaviors, and combinations as well, and then portrays a variety of situations and best-case reactions. It's all based on psychologist William Marston's 1920s research, which the author has refined for everyday work environments. Recognizing these four styles--dominance, influence, supportiveness, conscientiousness--is relatively easy. Ritchey details these topics for both pure and mixed behaviors: for instance, what motivates you, what discourages you, what is your favorite environment, what do you avoid, areas of misunderstanding, information to share, what to watch out for, getting unstuck, and your bottom line. No personality changes here but, rather, the ultimate in "knowing thyself" and subsequent adaptations. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Theirs is the language of self-questioning&#x2014;metaphors that turn against themselves, syntax that moves one way because it threatens to move another. Poems resist themselves more strenuously than they are resisted by the cultures receiving them.<br> <br> But the resistance to poetry is quite specifically the wonder of poetry. Considering a wide array of poets, from Virgil and Milton to Dickinson and Gl�ck, Longenbach suggests that poems convey knowledge only inasmuch as they refuse to be vehicles for the efficient transmission of knowledge. In fact, this self-resistance is the source of the reader's pleasure: we read poetry not to escape difficulty but to embrace it.<br> <br> An astute writer and critic of poems, Longenbach makes his case through a sustained engagement with the language of poetry. Each chapter brings a fresh perspective to a crucial aspect of poetry (line, syntax, figurative language, voice, disjunction) and shows that the power of poetry depends less on meaning than on the way in which it means&#x2014;on the temporal process we negotiate in the act of reading or writing a poem. Readers and writers who embrace that process, Longenbach asserts, inevitably recoil from the exaggeration of the cultural power of poetry in full awareness that to inflate a poem's claim on our attention is to weaken it.<br> <br> A graceful and skilled study, <i>The Resistance to Poetry</i> honors poetry by allowing it to be what it is. This book arrives at a critical moment&#x2014;at a time when many people are trying to mold and market poetry into something it is not.</p></p><p><b>James Longenbach</b> is the Joseph Henry Gilmore Professor of English at the University of Rochester and the author of four distinguished critical studies of modern literature, most recently <i>Modern Poetry after Modernism</i>.

Foreword by Diane Adreon, PhD.</p><p>Haley Moss was born in Boca Raton, Florida, and was diagnosed with high-functioning autism at the age of 3. Her prognosis was not promising. However, Haley has defied all odds and now is a student at one of the top private schools in the nation. Now 15, Haley is a sophomore in high school and wants to help kids on the autism spectrum get through daily challenges, both socially and academically. She enjoys being able to give back to the autism community through sharing her experiences and artwork.Haley Moss, in her own words, has created a very helpful guide for girls on the spectrum - and, indeed, any girl who experiences challenges in 'fitting in.' Her book is practical and insightful. Drawing on her own experiences, Haley provides a wonderful template for social success. --Brenda Smith Myles, PhD, consultant, author, and national and international speaker<br><br>As a mother of a middle-school-aged daughter with autism spectrum disorder, I find Middle School: The Stuff Nobody Tells You About a MUST read.

And so, of the more than 500,000 African-Americans who had registered to vote across the South, the vast majority former slaves, by 1906, less than ten percent remained. Many of those were terrified to go the polls, lest they be beaten, murdered, or have their homes burned to the ground. None of this was done in the shadows&#x2015;those determined to wrest the vote from black Americans could not have been more boastful in either intent or execution. But the Court chose to ignore the obvious and wrote decisions at odds with the Constitution, preferring to instead reinforce the racial stereotypes of the day.<br> <i>On Account Of Race</i> tells the story of an American tragedy, the only occasion in United States history in which a group of citizens who had been granted the right to vote then had it stripped away. Even more unjust was that this theft of voting rights was done with full approval, even the sponsorship, of the United States Supreme Court.</p><p><b>LAWRENCE GOLDSTONE</b> is the author of five books and numerous articles on constitutional law. His reviews and opinion pieces have appeared in, among other publications, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, <i>Miami Herald</i>, <i>The New Republic</i>, and <i>Tablet</i>.

This is a significant conversation.&#x201d; &#x2013;&#x2013;Jay Winik, bestselling author of <i>April 1865</i> and <i>1944</i></p> <p>"In a book both reasonable and readable, Lawrence Goldstone effectively challenges the convenient mythology that racial segregation was a policy reflecting merely the isolated prejudices of the southern American states in the post&#x2013;Civil War era. His main focus is the U.S. Supreme Court and the peculiar, absurdly twisted logic across a series of critical cases by which the justices undermined the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, systematically legitimating Jim Crow. The lesson is clear: that voting and other basic rights, unless broadly defended, can rest on fragile foundations indeed." &#x2013;&#x2013;Ronald King, professor of political science at San Diego State University and coauthor of <i>Removal of the Property Qualification for Voting in the United States</i> </p><p>"No right is more important than the vote. Yet in this engaging and highly readable book, Lawrence Goldstone shows how the Supreme Court, the supposed guardian of our fundamental rights, has repeatedly failed to protect this right for the most vulnerable Americans. With an eye for detail and irony, Goldstone uncovers the dramatic stories behind the cases in which the Court left racial minorities to fend for themselves in a hostile democracy." &#x2013;&#x2013;Adam Winkler, professor at UCLA School of Law and National Book Award finalist for <i>We the Corporations</i></p> <p>"Understanding that the right to vote is the guardian of other rights we possess, <i>On Account of Race: The Supreme Court, White Supremacy, and the Ravaging of African American Voting Rights</i> skillfully and with measured patience, deep insight, and extraordinary attention to primary source evidence charts the course of the United States Supreme Court&#x2019;s abandonment of African American Fifteenth Amendment voting rights and Fourteenth Amendment equality under the law civil rights. In a compelling manner, Goldstone lays bare the glaring and in many instances jarring evidence of the brutal physical suppression of African Americans in the post&#x2013;Civil War South by white &#x201c;Redeemers,&#x201d; and the High Court&#x2019;s serendipitous avoidance of the evidence of sustained discrimination against especially African Americans seeking to use their civil and voting rights. Goldstone&#x2019;s meticulous research brings forward the numerous cases brought before the Court by African American litigants seeking redress, even as he demonstrates persuasively that African Americans had no ally in the High Court as they and the relatively small numbers of whites who supported them sought to realize the equality promised them by Reconstruction Era amendments to the nation&#x2019;s Constitution. Simply put, for nearly one hundred years following the Reconstruction Era&#x2019;s goal of biracial democracy in the South, the High Court used its jurisprudence to give sanction to the white supremacy that eviscerated African American civil rights and voting rights. Further, Goldstone notes that African American voter suppression by the proponents of white supremacy is with us again. White supremacy advocates have long sought to weaken or destroy the enforcement preclearance (Sections 2 and 5) provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as those were the oversight mechanisms that ensured the ability of racial and ethnic minorities to vote in parts of the country with a deep history of voter suppression. On June 25, 2013, in a 5&#x2013;4 decision, <i>Shelby County, Alabama v. Holder</i>, Chief Justice Roberts cast the decisive vote in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that allowed states and localities to change their election laws without federal Department of Justice preclearance. Since then, under various ruses, rigging election systems and promoting voter suppression have been thwarting the right to vote and once again promoting white supremacy that is chipping away at our democracy." &#x2015;Marsha J. Tyson Darling, PhD, director of African, Black and Caribbean studies at Adelphi University and editor of <i>Race, Voting, Redistricting and the Constitution</i> </p><p>"Lawrence Goldstone&#x2019;s book <i>On Account of Race</i> is a careful and brilliant analysis of the effort of the Southern states to deprive the African American population of the right to vote after Reconstruction ended in 1877. There was no disguise of their purpose and no restriction on the method they used. From the grandfather clause or poll taxes or literacy tests, whatever could be used to block African Americans from voting was openly and emphatically applied. The white population was simply determined to keep the ballot box for themselves. Goldstone shows how the courts refused to interfere in any way with this program. Even such noteworthy judges as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes approved the effort. The book carefully examines the campaign, which lasted almost one hundred years until the Voting Rights Act of 1965." &#x2013;&#x2013;Leon Friedman, Joseph Kushner Distinguished Professor of Civil Liberties Law at Hofstra University</p> <p><b>Praise for <i>Inherently Unequal</i></b></p> <p>"Goldstone offers a clear, cogent reading of the court's machinations, no small accomplishment since the justices generally rested their opinions on convoluted legal reasoning rather than on broad principles. And he&#x2019;s completely convincing when he argues that behind those carefully parsed opinions lay a deep-seated racism strengthened by the justices&#x2019; embrace of Social Darwinism." &#x2015;<i>The Washington Post</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Convincingly lays the blame for this tragedy of Jim Crow at the door of the institution that could have made the difference but did not: the United States Supreme Court.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p> <p>"In this comprehensive and remarkably lucid study of post&#x2013;Civil War Supreme Court decisions, Goldstone shows how the court's narrow interpretation of the 14th amendment&#x2015;bestowing 'equal protection under the law' to all Americans, regardless of race&#x2015;paved the way for future decisions that diminished the status of African-Americans." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p> <p>"An absorbing account of the Supreme Court's role following the Civil War." &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p> <p>"A furious indictment of the Supreme Court as an accessory to the anti-democratic machinations of Gilded Age elites." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p> <p>"One of the saddest episodes in American history has been inadequately explored and poorly understood&#x2015;until now. Lawrence Goldstone&#x2019;s brilliantly written book, <i>Inherently Unequal</i>, traces the post-Reconstruction Supreme Court&#x2019;s slow strangulation of equal rights for African-Americans. It will be a shock to many that the judicial branch, viewed in the modern context as the premier defender of civil rights, was primarily responsible for the nation&#x2019;s descent into a deep, racist inequality that ruined the lives of millions for a century. As Goldstone shows us, Lincoln&#x2019;s great legacy was cynically dismantled by the officeholders best positioned to protect it." &#x2015;Larry J. Sabato, Director, Center for Politics, University of Virginia, and author of <i>A More Perfect Constitution</i></p> <p>"The great puzzle of nineteenth-century American history is why the North waded through blood and gore to free the slaves during the Civil War, only to allow them to be stripped of their civil rights and subject to relentless terror after. Lawrence Goldstone does a brilliant job of showing how the Supreme Court led the way by interpreting the Constitution so as to legalize what was little better than neo-slavery. <i>Inherently Unequal</i> is a valuable corrective for anyone who still believes that judges are above politics or that the Constitution is a clear-cut charter of liberty." &#x2015;Daniel Lazare, author of <i>The Frozen Republic</i></p> <p><b>Praise for <i>Dark Bargain: Slavery, Profits, and the Struggle for the Constitution</i></b></p> <p>"Mr. Goldstone shows the specter of slavery lurking behind so many of the delegates' disputes.

With sound research and a lively style, Goldstone shows there was no such thing as a single 'original intent.' that he does so in such a robust, entertaining and accessible style is an advantage that even the Constitution's drafters would have appreciated."&#x2015;<i>The Denver Post</i></p> <p>"Mr. Goldstone does not evince any political purpose in this book. But when we see the founders as ordinary men (or worse, ordinary politicians), we can readily see how absurd it is when judges claim to discover, in the brief text of the Constitution, a moral right to abortion or sodomy, an injunction against creches on public property or new rules for professional golf. Today, the Constitution is little read but widely venerated. <i>Dark Bargain</i> makes the document accessible. Both are highly recommended." &#x2015;<i>The Washington Times</i></p> <p>"<i>Dark Bargain</i> puts slavery near the heart of the making of the Constitution, where it belongs.

Jim and Terry Willard have compiled an invaluable volume that makes researching one&#39;s own family lineage both accessible and fun. Based on the 10-part PBS series by the same name, Ancestors covers all the bases including creating a pedigree chart or family tree, finding and interpreting documents, and searching for your roots online. Jim and Terry Willard explain each technique with the assistance of ten expert genealogists. The book includes additional information not discussed in the series that will make it an invaluable companion for all would-be family historians.</p><p>Jim Willard is a contributor for Houghton Mifflin Company titles including: &#34;Ancestors.&#34;This work is the companion book to the television series of the same name that aired on PBS affiliates in January and February 1997. Alex Haley, who was actively involved in producing the Ancestors series before his untimely death, summed up the heart of the project and shed light on the passion for genealogy: "In all of us there is a hunger, marrow deep, to know our heritage....Without this enriching knowledge there is a hollow yearning." The book's ten chapters match the ten-part TV series and illustrate methods for getting started; the final appendix offers a resource directory. A reading list, a pedigree chart, a family group record, a research log, and advice on where to write for vital records conclude this richly illustrated introductory book. A good beginning handbook for genealogists, this is essential for major genealogy collections. Be advised, however, that it joins a long line of outstanding works for beginners that can be found by consulting the subject heading "Genealogy-handbooks."?Judith P.

Bernard DeVoto catches a people moving west: Twain&#x2019;s own family drifting down the Ohio, emigrants of every stripe, the famous and the obscure. Answering genteel critics such as Van Wyck Brooks, who blamed the American frontier for stifling Twain&#x2019;s genius, DeVoto shows that, in fact, Twain&#x2019;s early days in Nevada and California made a writer of him. <i>Mark Twain&#x2019;s America</i>, first published in 1932, enriched by western humor and supernatural slave lore, is an enduring work of American literary and cultural criticism.</p><p>Bernard DeVoto (1897-1955) is one of the great poets of American history; he was a man who allowed the American land to shape his sweeping narratives. This overlooked book, first published in 1932, celebrates the places Mark Twain knew and wrote about, and it celebrates as well Twain&#39;s humor and disenchantment. &#34;Twain laughs,&#34; writes DeVoto, &#34;and, for the first time, American literature possesses tragic laughter.&#34; The tragedy comes, of course, from the darker moments of the continent&#39;s conquest, to several of which Twain was an unflinching witness. To read DeVoto is to see with Twain&#39;s own eyes the great rivers, mining camps, mountains, and forests of America a century ago.The historian Bernard DeVoto (1897&#x2013;1955) won a Pulitzer Prize for <i>Across the Wide Missouri</i>.

Professor Klemke begins by pointing out the distinctions among the various types of analytic and linguistic philosophies, while emphasizing that they all arose as a response to the formerly predominant school of absolute idealism. After a prologue section containing a representative exposition of idealism by Josiah Royce, the following sections show the radically new philosophical approach of the analytic school in its various guises: realism and common sense (G. E. Moore); logical atomism (Bertrand Russell); logical positivism (A. J. Ayer); conceptual analysis (Gilbert Ryle, G. E. Moore, John Wisdom); logico-metaphysical analysis (Gustav Bergman, W. V. Quine); linguistic analysis (J. L. Austin, P. F. Strawson, J. R. Searle); and the recent development of new realism (Saul Kripke, Hilary Putnam, Tyler Burge, Richard N. Boyd).</p><p>The late <b>E. D.

Beginning with a discussion of how and what Elizabethans read--manuscripts, popular pamphlets, and books--Robert S. Miola examines Shakespeare's use of specific texts such as Holinshed's <em>Chronicles</em>, Plutarch's <em>Lives</em>, and Chaucer's <em>The Canterbury Tales</em>. As well as reshaping other writers' work, Shakespeare transformed traditions--the inherited expectations, tropes, and strategies about character, action and genre. For example, the tradition of Italian love poetry, especially Petrarch, shapes <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> as well as the sonnets; the Vice figure finds new life in Richard III and Falstaff. Employing a traditional understanding of sources as well as more recent developments in intertextuality, this book traces Shakespeare's reading throughout his career, as it inspires his poetry, histories, comedies, tragedies, and romances. Repeated references to the plays in performance enliven and enrich the account.<br></p><p><br>Robert S.

This is the kind of insight that makes <i>The Age of Innocence </i> so indispensable. Wharton's story of the upper classes of Old New York, and Newland Archer's impossible love for the disgraced Countess Olenska, is a perfectly wrought book about an era when upper-class culture in this country was still a mixture of American and European extracts, and when "society" had rules as rigid as any in history.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms. It will include novels, poetry, short stories, essays, travel-writing and other non-fiction. The series will be extensive and open-ended and will provide school students with a range of edited texts taken from a wide geographical spread.</p><h2>Fundamentals of Logistics Management (The Irwin/McGraw-Hill Series in Marketing)</h2><p>In an era when most managers--including those in the logistics arena--are being urged to think of themselves as &#34;marketers,&#34; this new book offers a special opportunity.

Feminist legal philosophy has generated a great deal of interest among feminists, philosophers, legal scholars, sociologists and political scientists in recent years. The readings in this collection are organized according to the traditional topics in a typical jurisprudence course: the nature and justification of law; judicial reasoning and the process of adjudication; and the connection between law and equality, freedom and justice. At the same time, they provide balanced coverage of those feminist topics of current interest that are most discussed in legal and philosophical literature today.</p><p>Patricia Smith is at University of Kentucky."This book is important primarily because it is so clear and explicit in setting forth the ideology of radical or gender feminism in relationship to the law."--Issues in Child Abuse Accusations<br><br>"The reader gets a fully developed view of the complexity of feminist jurisprudence without being overwhelmed....This brief review cannot do justice to the wealth of material available in Smith's book, which represents the work of many of the major voices in feminist jurisprudence....Smith's<br>volume frees those of us who now teach these courses from the burden and questionable legality of endless photocopying.

It differs from most other textbooks on evolution in three fundamental ways: First, it is intended for students taking evolution early in their studies. Second, it examines the intellectual significance of Darwinian evolution. Third, the text departs from the standard treatment of evolution in other textbooks, wherein the arguments are reductionist, molecular, and overwhelmingly genetic in emphasis. <p>Ken Kardong, also author of Vertebrates; Comparative Anatomy, Function, Evolution, is known for his accessible writing style.

Downs (1923-1999) focuses on the pastoral aspects of Nez Ch'ii society and culture. The tribe still holds to a pastoral herding ecology that has characterized some of the Navajo for at least 250 years. Downs outlines the important themes of the culture (including the importance of females, the inviolability of the individual, the prestige of age, and the reciprocity principle), and discusses, in detail, the relationships between the Nez Ch'ii families and their sheep herds as well as their relationship to the dominant culture surrounding them.<p> Title of related interest from Waveland Press: Simonelli, <i>Crossing between Worlds: The Navajo of Canyon de Chelly,</i> Second Edition (ISBN 9781577665472).</p><p> Visit waveland.com for a complete list of modern and classic ethnographies on Apache, Comanche, Crow, Navajo, Papago, Pueblo, Shoshone, Sioux, and other American Indian cultures.</p></p><p>Title of related interest also from Waveland Press: Simonelli, Crossing between Worlds: The Navajo of Canyon de Chelly, Second Edition (ISBN 9781577665472).</p><h2>Art of Vietnam (Temporis Collection)</h2><p>Since the foundation of the Au Lac kingdom three centuries ago - famous for their bronze drums and their magnificent artilleries - until the works of the painters from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts of Indochina, created in Hanoi in 1925, the arts of Vietnam have been marked by its profoundly original cultures and the fusion between Asia and the Occident. The modern Vietnamese civilization has therefore inherited a very rich and multifaceted history.<p>Long forgotten during the civil unrest of the late 20th century, the Vietnamese arts have remained largely unrecognized. Recent years however have seen art culture begin to blossom again and new discoveries are being made. In this book, the authors have chosen to present these findings in a historical perspective, situating them in the heart of a twice-millennial tradition.</p><p>A particular work has been realized on the iconography, associating views of some remarkable landscapes - many in the country that shelters the Ha Long Bay - the negatives of a Vietnamese photographer, scenes of the life in the countryside, and pictures of civilian and religious monuments.

George has become the unofficial spokesperson for responsible leadership&#x2014;in business, the media, and academia. <p>In <i>Authentic Leadership</i> Bill George makes the case that we do need new leaders, not just new laws, to bring us out of the current corporate crisis. He persuasively demonstrates that authentic leaders of mission-driven companies will create far greater shareholder value than financially oriented companies. During George's twelve-year leadership at Medtronic, the company's market capitalization soared from $1.1 billion to $460 billion, averaging 35% per year.</p> <p>George candidly recounts many of the toughest challenges he encountered -- from ethical dilemmas and battles with the FDA to his own development as a leader. He shows how to develop the five essential dimensions of authentic leaders&#x2014;purpose, values, heart, relationships, and self-discipline. Authentic Leadership offers inspiring lessons to all who want to lead with heart and with compassion for those they serve.</p> <p>Bill George helps readers answer vital questions such as: What should I do when my personal values conflict with company business values? How do I make trade-offs between the needs of my customers, my employees, and my company's shareholders?

The success of the sustainability discourse depends both on the pedagogic and research functions of higher education. Similarly, for higher education itself to remain relevant and engaged it faces pressure not only to integrate the insights and lessons drawn from the perspective of sustainable development, but also to be responsive to scrutiny of its own practices in relation to sustainability. Among professionals in higher education, sustainable development has its supporters and detractors. It is embraced by some individuals and departments while being perceived by others as a threat to the coherence of particular disciplines. Although it is not currently an academic discipline in its own right, increasing public and professional familiarity with the term, and the increasing urgency of global calls for the implementation of sustainable development mean that this is rapidly changing. This volume analyses the impact of the concepts and practices of sustainability and sustainable development on various academic disciplines, institutional practices, fields of study and methods of enquiry. The contributors, drawn from a wide-range of disciplines, perspectives, educational levels and institutional contexts, examine the purpose of the modern university and the nature of sustainable education, which includes exploring links to social movements for sustainability projects, curriculum change, culture and biodiversity, values relating to gender equality and global responsibility, and case studies on the transformation, or otherwise, of some specific disciplines.</p><p>John Blewitt is deputy director of the Department of Lifelong Learning at the University of Exeter.

This book consists of six Lenten meditations preached by the author, an eloquent speaker and profound thinker, on the subject of the pain of Christ along with a paper he wrote later that developed some of the themes touched on during the course of the meditations. Having personally distributed more than 15 copies of this book to university students and clergy and having discussed it with them I have found that its clairity, depth of spiritual insight and willingness to deal with important subjects in a forthright manner have born much fruit in the lives of those who take up and read this small book.

Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).</p><p>&nbsp;<br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br> &nbsp;<br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely.

Published in February 1947, &#x201c;the Bus,&#x201d; as Steinbeck referred to it in his letters, was his first long and much-anticipated novel after <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> eight years earlier and his last big novel before <i>East of Eden</i> five years later. With ten major characters, however, the novel&#x2019;s unconventional ensemble cast or its unorthodox moral code or its overtly allegorical form may have limited its popularity. But make no mistake: &#x201c;The Bus&#x201d; is a major novel by a major American author and it deserves to attract a new generation of readers.</p><p>Steinbeck struck on the premise for the story in Mexico in the spring of 1945 while completing <i>The Pearl</i>. Originally he thought he would develop the idea in a tale of picaresque adventure &#x201c;something like the Don Quixote of Mexico&#x201d; or in a short novel the length of <i>The Red Pony</i> (1937). Gradually, however, the story of these pilgrims and their journey swelled into an ambitious novel of more than a hundred thousand words. As he wrote his friend and editor Pascal Covici from Cuernavaca on July 12, 1945, &#x201c;The more I think of it the better I like it and the better I like it the longer its plan and the wider its scope until it seems to contain the whole world. From the funny little story it is growing to the most ambitious thing I have ever attempted. Not that it still won&#x2019;t be funny but funny as Tom Jones and Tristram Shandy and Don Quixote are funny. And it isn&#x2019;t going to take a little time to write but a long time and I don&#x2019;t care, for my bus is something large in my mind. It is a cosmic bus holding sparks and back firing into the Milky Way and turning the corner of Betelgeuse without a hand signal. And Juan Chicoy the driver is all the gods the father you ever saw driving a six cylinder broken down, battered world through time and space. If I can do it well The Wayward Bus will be a pleasant thing.&#x201d; What a whaling ship and a man of war were for Herman Melville and Jack London, what a stagecoach was for John Ford, a bus was for John Steinbeck. His wayward bus &#x201c;Sweetheart&#x201d; is the lineal ancestor of Ken Kesey&#x2019;s psychedelic bus &#x201c;Further,&#x201d; another conveyance that would backfire into the Milky Way a generation later.</p><p>As for the title: The first synopsis of the story, Steinbeck remembered, &#x201c;was written in Spanish&#x201d; and &#x201c;was called El Cami�n Vacilador. The word vacilador, or the verb vacilar, is not translatable unfortunately, and it&#x2019;s a word we really need in English because to be &#x2018;vacilando&#x2019; means that you&#x2019;re aiming at some place, but you don&#x2019;t care much whether you get there. We don&#x2019;t have such a word in English. Wayward has an overtone of illic itness or illegality, based of course on medieval lore where wayward men were vagabonds. But vacilador is not a vagabond at all. Wayward was the nearest English word that I could find.&#x201d;</p><p>Steinbeck wrote much of the novel at his kitchen table in New York &#x201c;amid jampots and pieces of cold toast and stale coffee,&#x201d; and he destroyed &#x201c;about 20,000 words&#x201d; in January 1946 because he was dissatisfied with them. In May 1946 he reported that &#x201c;For two months I&#x2019;ve been fighting the Bus and only now have I got a start which seems good. I&#x2019;ve thrown away thousands of words. But I think it is good now. And at least it is moving.&#x201d; He finished a draft in October 1946. In all, he spent nearly two years crafting the novel. Despite assertions that his writing was uneven, Steinbeck&#x2019;s work on the story was not haphazard. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t any idea as to whether it is any good or not,&#x201d; he admitted to friends. &#x201c;But the people in it are alive, so much so that sometimes they take a tack I didn&#x2019;t suspect they were going to.&#x201d; &#x201c;I hope you will like it,&#x201d; Steinbeck wrote his boyhood friend Jack Wagner, &#x201c;although &#x2018;like&#x2019; is not the word to use. You nor anyone can&#x2019;t <i>like</i> it. But at least I think it is effective. It is interesting to me&#x2014;. . . This book depends on mood, on detail and on all the little factors of writing for its effectiveness. It has practically no story.&#x201d; He elsewhere allowed that &#x201c;It is what I wanted to say and I think it is in there for anyone who really wants to find it and there&#x2019;s a top story for those who don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; As Steinbeck predicted, &#x201c;It will be called simple character study and that is only the littlest part of what it is.&#x201d;</p><p>Published to great fanfare, <i>The Wayward Bus</i> was an immediate bestseller. It enjoyed a first printing of 750,000 copies and was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection. Two weeks before its formal release on February 15, Steinbeck reported that &#x201c;The advance sale of the Bus are stupendous. Something near to a million copies. . . . This is completely fantastic. The people who are going to attack it are buying it like mad.&#x201d; Steinbeck&#x2019;s observation was prescient. The novel received contradictory or mixed notices at best. &#x201c;The reviews of the Bus out today,&#x201d; the author again wrote Wagner. &#x201c;I should never read reviews, good or bad. They just confuse me because they cancel each other out and end up by meaning nothing. I should let them alone. The book is getting good notices mostly here [New York], although a couple of my congenital enemies are sniping. That is good for a book. The more arguments the better.&#x201d; On the one hand, for example, the novel was hailed by Harrison Smith in the <i>Saturday Review of Literature</i>: &#x201c;It stands by itself, the work of a writer as distinctively American as Mark Twain, who has developed in power and dramatic talent for almost twenty years.&#x201d; It was also saluted by Carlos Baker, professor of English at Princeton University, in the <i>New York Times</i>: &#x201c;This modern version of a medieval palimpsest will provide, for the thoughtful, one more handle to Steinbeck&#x2019;s parable of Everyman.&#x201d; Yet Frank O&#x2019;Malley scorned the novel in <i>Commonweal</i>, a Catholic weekly. O&#x2019;Malley&#x2019;s hyperbolic review was particularly savage: &#x201c;Steinbeck&#x2019;s dreary, prurient pilgrimage has no real human or universal significance. It is nothing more than an unusually dismal bus ride&#x2014;more dismal, depraved and meaningless than any man anywhere has ever taken.&#x201d; Harry Hansen in <i>Survey Graphic</i> was even more caustic: &#x201c;Another load of sleazy characters who deserved oblivion rather than the accolade of a book club.&#x201d; A year later, Steinbeck wrote Covici that he hoped &#x201c;some time some people will know what the <i>Bus</i> was about. Even with the lead, they didn&#x2019;t discover.&#x201d;</p><p>The &#x201c;lead&#x201d; to which Steinbeck referred, of course, was the epigram to the fable from the late-fifteenth-century English morality play <i>Everyman</i>. &#x201c;The Bus&#x201d; is a moralizing book, even if its moral is neither obvious nor particularly reassuring. Like a medieval morality play or any drama constructed according to the classical &#x201c;unities&#x201d; (including Eugene O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s <i>Long Day&#x2019;s Journey into Night</i>), Steinbeck&#x2019;s story transpires in the course of a single day, opening before dawn in the lunchroom at Rebel Corners and ending after dusk as the bus nears its destination of San Juan de la Cruz (Saint John of the Cross). Moreover, just as the characters in <i>Everyman</i> are personifications (for example, Beauty, Strength, Fellowship, Good Deeds), <i>The Wayward Bus</i> is a type of allegory temporally set in spring, the traditional season of pilgrimages, with archetypal or representative figures whose names denote their roles. Though Steinbeck had originally set the story in Mexico, he transferred it to his familiar Salinas Valley, where he was born and lived the first eighteen years of his life. Still, none of the place names in the novel, with the notable exceptions of such southern cities as Los Angeles, Hollywood, and San Diego, refer to actual sites. There is a Santa Cruz, California, of course, but no San Juan de la Cruz, as in the novel; and there is a San Ysidro, California, but it is located in San Diego County, nowhere near the San Ysidro of the story. Put another way, Steinbeck moved his narrative from Mexico to an imaginary central California because the novel is, at its top or most literal level, a commentary on post-World War II America.</p><p>Steinbeck establishes the parameters of his topical satire in the opening pages of the novel. The crossroads of Rebel Corners, where Juan and Alice Chicoy run the garage and lunchroom, was established during the Civil War. After the war its founders, Confederate sympathizers named Blankens&#x2014;ciphers destined to disappear, as their name implies&#x2014;became &#x201c;lazy and quarrelsome and full of hatred and complaints, as every defeated nation does.&#x201d; The novel appeared early in the cold war, of course, in the midst of a national debate over policy toward the defeated Axis powers. Only weeks later Secretary of State George C. Marshall would propose the European Reconstruction Act, better known as the Marshall Plan, designed to help European nations recover from the ravages of World War II and to contain Soviet expansion. The novel also contains a number of incidental references to World War II&#x2014;to the draft, to rationing, to wage and price controls, as well as a subtle allusion in the first chapter to &#x201c;Atom ites,&#x201d; a new race of people who live in the shadow of a mushroom cloud. As Steinbeck wrote in his last book <i>America and Americans</i> (1966), &#x201c;Under the pressure of war we finally made the atom bomb, and for reasons which seemed justifiable at the time we dropped it on two Japanese cities&#x2014;and I think we finally frightened ourselves.&#x201d; In the dialogue between Elliott Pritchard and the army veteran Ernest Horton in chapter 9, Steinbeck also glosses the then-current debate over how to integrate the discharged soldiers into a domestic economy most Americans believed was doomed to plunge into recession with the end of the war. In this sense, Steinbeck&#x2019;s novel considers the predicament of the returning soldiers much like William Wyler&#x2019;s movie <i>The Best Years of Our Lives</i> (1946).</p><p>Steinbeck also recognizes other major social changes endemic to the postwar period: increasing commercialization, especially the commercialization of sex, and the new roles available to women. The lunchroom at Rebel Corners is decorated with calendar girls and Coca-Cola posters picturing beautiful women. Despite their brand name, Mother Mahoney&#x2019;s home-baked pies are baked in a factory, and Mother Mahoney, like Aunt Jemima and Betty Crocker, is a figment of an advertiser&#x2019;s imagination. With a sort of rugged realism, Steinbeck insists on specifying the brands of cola drinks, candy bars, and cigarettes and the names of upscale Hollywood restaurants and hotels. Elliott Pritchard&#x2019;s gold nail pick, watch, and key chain and his wife Bernice&#x2019;s &#x201c;three-quarter-length black fox coat&#x201d; perfect...</p></p><h2>Helping Your Child with Language-Based Learning Disabilities: Strategies to Succeed in School and Life with Dyslexia, Dysgraphia, Dyscalculia, ADHD, and Processing Disorders</h2><p><p><b>Based in cutting-edge research in neuroscience, education, and the principles of attachment-based teaching, this important guide for parents offers tools and practices to help children transcend language-based learning difficulties, do better in school, and gain self-confidence and self-esteem.</b></p><p>If your child has a language-based learning difficulty&#x2014;such as dyscalculia, dyslexia, and auditory processing disorder&#x2014;they may have to work twice as hard to keep up with their peers in school.

Ethnobotany is critical to the growing importance of developing new crops and products such as drugs from traditional plants.&nbsp; </p> <p>This book is the basic introduction to the field, showing how botany, anthropology, ecology, economics and linguistics are all employed in the techniques and methods involved. It explains data collection and hypothesis testing and provides practical ideas on fieldwork ethics and the application of results to conservation and community development. Case studies illustrate the explanations, demonstrating the importance of collaboration in achieving results.&nbsp; </p> <p>Published with WWF, UNESCO and Royal Botanic Gardens Kew.</p></p><p>Gary Martin is Director of the Global Diversity Foundation and a Research Fellow and Lecturer in the Anthropology Department at the University of Kent at Canterbury.I caught a glimpse of the table of contents, and it looks wonderful - Society for Economic Botany Newsletter; ...provides a detailed overview of this emerging discipline. Aimed primarily at researchers who are beginning field studies, it gives clear descriptions of the skills and methods most commonly employed by ethnobotanists. It will also be of interest to experienced field workers who wish to review new concepts and techniques drawn from botany, anthropology, economics, ethnopharmacology and other disciplines.. - Krypto News; However, in keeping the text firmly focused on the discussion of field techniques and rooted in a project base, with the use of real examples, Martin succeeds in providing some valuable information about research tools.

In contrast to the lofty debates between radical theorists, these nine studies excavate the dynamics and histories of globalization by extending out from the concrete, everyday world. <br><br>The authors were participant observers in diverse struggles over extending citizenship, medicalizing breast cancer, dumping toxic waste, privatizing nursing homes, the degradation of work, the withdrawal of welfare rights, and the elaboration of body politics. From their insider vantage points, they show how groups negotiate, circumvent, challenge, and even re-create the complex global web that entangles them. Traversing continents and extending over three years, this collaborative research developed its own distinctive method of "grounded globalization" to grasp the evaporation of traditional workplaces, the dissolution of enclaved communities, and the fluidity of identities. Forged between the local and global, these compelling essays make a powerful case for ethnography's insight into global dynamics. <br><br></p><p>"At last world.com meets ethnography.eudora. This book shows how ethnography can have a global reach and a global relevance, its humanistic and direct methods actually made more not less relevant by recent developments in global culture and economy. `Globalisation` is not a singular, unilinear process, fatalistically unfolding towards inevitable ends: it entails gaps, contradictions, counter-tendencies, and marked unevenness. And just as capital flows more freely around the globe, so do human ideas and imaginings, glimpses of other possible futures. These elements all interact in really existing sites, situations and localities, not in outer space or near-earth orbit. Unprefigurably, they are taken up into all kinds of local meanings-makings by active humans struggling and creating with conditions on the ground, so producing new kinds of meanings and identities, themselves `up for export` on the world market. This book, conceptually rich, empirically concrete, shows how global neo-liberalism spawns a grounded globalisation, ethnographically observable, out of which is emerging the mosaic of a new kind of global civil society. As this book so richly shows, tracing the lineaments of these possibilities and changes is the special province of ethnography."&#x2015;Paul Willis, author of <i>Learning to Labor</i> and editor of the journal <i>Ethnography</i><br><br>"The authors of <i>Global Ethnography</i> bring globalization 'down to earth' and show us how it impacts the everyday lives of Kerala nurses, U.S. homeless recyclers, Irish software programmers, Hungarian welfare recipients, Brazilian feminists, and a host of other protagonists in a global postmodern world.

The book traces the phenomenon of fascism through the history of ideas, previous political movements, and the events of the First World War. Although the focus is principally fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, the book also gives detailed attention to the Romanian Iron Guard, Franco's Spain, Japan and proto-fascist movements around the globe.</p> <p>The author explores the reasons for both the limits of fascism's appeal and the historical transcendence of the "fascist era".The inclusion of other forms of authoritarian nationalism lays a foundation for comparative analysis and leads to a more workable definition of authoritarianism.</p> <p>It should be useful reading for students studying the rise of totalitarianism in twentieth-century Europe and for those concerned about the rise of ultranationalism today.</p></p><p>This is the first full history of fascism - as a force and as a phenomenon - in Europe and elsewhere between the world wars. This history encompasses all the major fascist movements, as well as other forms of authoritarian nationalism, and provides in-depth analyses of these movements, the interpretative problems they pose, and previous interpretations of them. Stanley G. Payne interprets fascism as a form of revolutionary ultranationalism - a program for national rebirth based on a primarily vitalist philosophy, extreme elitism, mass mobilization, the promotion of violence, and military virtues. He traces this phenomenon through the history of ideas, previous political movements, and the events of World War I. Though his focus is chiefly on Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, he also gives detailed attention to the Romanian Iron Guard, Franco&#39;s Spain, Japan, and protofascist movements around the globe. In view of widespread speculation about the return of fascism to Europe and the Afro-Asian World, this work is especially timely. However, Payne presents a powerful case for viewing fascism as a unique &#34;epochal phenomenon&#34;. Conversely, he treats significant individual features of fascism as inherent aspects of revolutionary movements and nationalist dictatorships, with every likelihood of reappearing in new and different forms.Stanley G. Payne is the Hilldale&#x2013;Jaume Vicens Vives Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison.

Think again.&nbsp;All around the world, in fields ranging from astronomy to zoology, millions of everyday people are choosing to participate in the scientific process. Working in cooperation with scientists in pursuit of information, innovation, and discovery, these volunteers are following protocols, collecting and reviewing data, and sharing their observations.&nbsp;They are our neighbors, our in-laws, and people in the office down the hall.&nbsp;Their story, along with the story of the social good that can result from citizen science, has largely been untold, until now. Citizen scientists are challenging old notions about who can conduct research, where knowledge can be acquired, and even how solutions to some of our biggest societal problems might emerge. In telling their story, Cooper will inspire readers to rethink their own assumptions about the role that individuals can play in gaining scientific understanding and putting that understanding to use as stewards of our world. Citizen Science will be a rallying call-to-arms, and will also function as an authoritative resource for those inspired by the featured stories and message.</p><p>Caren Cooper is an associate professor of Forestry and Environmental Resources at North Carolina State University, part of the Chancellor&#x2019;s Faculty Excellence Program in Leadership in Public Science, and assistant head of the Biodiversity Research Lab at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.

Now in its third volume, this classic and proven pedagogy provides a much better basis for students to retain a knowledge base and extend it to practical applications in other areas of science. The mechanistic approach groups chemical reactions according to how the sequence of changes occurs- their common mechanisms- rather than by functional groups (what category- alcohols, amines, alkenes, etc.). Where appropriate, the text subdivides information based on functional groups. The text covers ALL of basic organic chemistry in the first 14 chapters and reviews the reactions covered in these chapters in chapter 15 on multi-step synthesis.

A concise and informative review of the most popular diet programs helps set the record straight on what&#39;s behind all of those promotional campaigns to which adolescent (and younger) girls are regularly exposed. The goal here is to help parents understand the kinds of pressure their daughters are under and to provide them with the necessary knowledge to work with their daughters - rather than against them - in forming a strong, positive, and clear sense of self.</p><p>Though easy to trivialize, weight loss and excessive exercise can cause significant health problems, and treatment has ballooned into a major industry. Costin, a therapist and former victim of an eating disorder, focuses on the most pathological problems: anorexia and bulimia nervosa and binge eating. Though she analyzes their social milieu, offering a statement of "Thin Commandments," this is primarily a how-to-cope guide for family members of the afflicted. Topics include symptoms, underlying psychological causes, separate preventative advice for parents, and a useful evaluation of today's most popular weight-loss programs and principles. The kind of concrete examples and practical guidance that may accompany professional therapy are provided in a supportive manner. Berg's work is a more expansive and polemical book, addressing most aspects of America's weight "crisis." Berg, a nutritionist and editor/publisher of Healthy Weight Journal, serves up a feast of facts on four major problems: dysfunctional eating, eating disorders, size prejudice, and remedies for the overweight. Condemning "diets," she instead proposes a wellness paradigm based on the Canadian "vitality" model, which calls for moderation in eating habits and an active, playful lifestyle. The book contains advice for parents but emphasizes that social change is needed in schools, organized sports, and federal policies that focus too narrowly on antiobesity. Unlike other books on this topic, the unique problems of boys and minority children are also explored. Though sometimes superficial and alarmist in tone, Berg's book is a valuable consciousness raiser. Both books are recommended for public libraries for both parents and concerned professionals needing inspiration.<br><i>Antoinette Brinkman, Southwest Indiana Mental Health Ctr.

Brought together by the deliciously evil "Gentleman," the bad guys each battle the webslinger at least once. The most intriguing of the six is Pity, a female with powers of darkness; Spider-Man suspects she might be his sister. Castro does an excellent job of capturing the feel of comic-book action through his prose. The lively scenes feature nearly over-the-top descriptions, balanced by dry and sometimes sarcastic humor. The intense, but playful tone involves readers in the intrigue and the battles, while recognizing that it's all in good fun. Sly nods to popular culture are peppered throughout, including references to characters from beyond the world of comics, such as the sheriff from Fargo and the evil Nazi from Marathon Man; even Scooby Doo and friends show up on the final pages. The daylong attack on New York fills up more than 100 pages, with plenty of quick scene changes and a large cast of supporting characters. Though they can be hard to keep track of, they add to the atmosphere of this bizarre city in which super-powered heroes and villains wage life and death battles on a fairly regular basis. Readers who haven't read the first two books in the trilogy will have no trouble catching on: Spider-Man himself sums up recent events in a funny lecture he gives to a ridiculous would-be villain. -Steven Engelfried, Beaverton City Library, OR <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Assured by God: Living in the Fullness of God&#39;s Grace</h2><p>Nothing stimulates Christian service more than humble assurance of God's saving grace. Many of us are immobilized by lingering doubts about our salvation or, worse, by a false security.<br><br>Is assurance of salvation reserved for the super-spiritual? Is it a sure sign of presumption? What are the benefits of assurance, and the dangers of an unsure faith? Separating truth from error, and viewing assurance in relation to its larger family of biblical doctrines, the contributors to this volume demonstrate its significance for grateful, productive Christian living.<br></p><p>"Assurance of God's gracious, saving, fatherly love to us in Christ is the hallmark of the Protestant Reformation's understanding of salvation. This assurance is vital to Christian life and witness. Unfortunately, too many saints lack assurance, and today there are even Reformed and evangelical preachers who are undermining it by erroneous teaching. Thankfully, a band of faithful brothers has given us this book to clear the fog, present the truth, protect us from wrong-headedness, and help us on our way. True, evangelical assurance enlarges our hearts with peace and joy, fills us with love and thankfulness to God, and strengthens and motivates us to glad, gospel obedience. Read this book prayerfully, with faith in God's Word, and be encouraged!" --<b>Ligon Duncan</b>, Senior Minister, First Presbyterian Church, Jackson, Mississippi<br><br>"The key to fruitfulness . . . is to have a life that is founded solidly on the assurance of one's salvation in Christ. The unsure Christian is the Christian who lacks stability in his or her faith. The unsure Christian is tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine. The unsure Christian is easy prey for the assault of Satan, who does everything in his malevolent power to undermine the Christian's confidence of salvation in Christ. A Christian who lacks such confidence can easily become trapped in insecurity and may lack the boldness to venture out into the domain of a fallen world, armed with the whole armor of God. . . . It is my prayer that those who read this volume will have those vacillating doubts that weaken their profession removed once and for all, so that they may be fully equipped to be fruit bearers in the vineyard of Christ." --<b>R.

Author Edgar Wachenheim is the 28-year CEO of Greenhaven Associates, boasting an average annual portfolio comparable to Warren Buffet's. In this book, he shares his knowledge and experiences by providing detailed analyses of actual investments made by himself and other investors. The discussion covers the entire investment process, including the softer, human side, with candid insight into the joys and frustrations, intensities and pressures, and risks and uncertainties. The unique emphasis on behavioral economics and real-world cases set this book apart from the herd&#x2014;but it's Wachenheim himself and his deeply-examined perspective that elevates the book beyond a mere investing guide.</p> <p>Between 1990 and 2014, a typical portfolio managed by Wachenheim enjoyed an average annual return in excess of 18%, achieved using relatively conservative stocks and no financial leverage.

Investors seeking real insight, real expertise, and a proven track record will find <i>Common Stocks and Common Sense</i> a uniquely useful resource.</p></p><p><p>There are many books on investing that describe investment principles and strategies&#x2014;this is not one of them. Following the same case-based pedagogy he learned from at the Harvard Business School, value- investing giant Ed Wachenheim illustrates how powerful principles and strategies for protecting and growing capital are employed in actual investment situations through personally selected trades made by his company, Greenhaven Associates, over its storied history. </p><p>Inside<i> Common Stocks and Common Sense</i>, you gain privileged access to the everyday investing approaches and strategies guiding one of the preeminent investment firms on Wall Street, as well as the research, analysis, models, and decision process used by its distinguished portfolio managers. In addition to going up close to how masters of the markets operate and draw wealth from opportunity, this practitioner's guide also delves into the behavioral side of investing, including the human emotions, pressures, and disappointments threatening every investor's chances at making a profit from transactions with inherent, and sometimes unseen, uncertainties and risks.

RUBIN,</b> Former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury </p><p>"Ed Wachenheim often emphasizes the great value of using one's 'common sense' as an investor. But after he describes how he has analyzed every imaginable dimension and variable of several organizations before deciding whether to buy their stock, we quickly realize that there is nothing even remotely 'common' about his ability to be both prescient and wise. This is a fascinating and enlightening book that is completely accessible to the layman, and should be required reading for professionals."<br> <b> &#x2014;NEIL L. RUDENSTINE,</b> Former President of Harvard University </p><p>"Ed Wachenheim is a very successful investor who has never sought the limelight.

Winter Griffith, M.D., </b>spent more than thirty years in private practice, university teaching, and hospital administration. Griffith wrote many books, including <i>Complete Guide to Symptoms, Illness &amp; Surgery</i>; <i>Complete Guide to Pediatric Symptoms, Illness &amp; Medications</i>; <i>Complete Guide to Sports Injuries</i>; and <i>Complete Guide to Symptoms, Illness &amp; Surgery for People Over 50</i>.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Stephen Moore, M.D., </b>is a family physician in Tucson, Arizona.<b>What is in This Book</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The purpose of this book is to give you information about the most widely used drugs (prescription and nonprescription). The information is derived from many authoritative sources and represents the consensus of many experts. Every effort has been made to ensure accuracy and completeness. However, because drug information is constantly changing, you should always talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns.<br> &nbsp;<br> The information applies to generic drugs in both the United States and Canada. Generic names do not vary in these countries, but brand names do. Each year, new drug charts are added and existing charts are updated when appropriate. For the most part, drugs that are injected by a medical professional, used mainly in a hospital (or medical clinic) or have rare usage are not included.<br> &nbsp;<br> A drug cannot &#x201c;cure.&#x201d; It aids the body&#x2019;s natural defenses to promote recovery. Likewise, a manufacturer or doctor cannot guarantee a drug will help every person. The complexity of the human body, individual responses in different people and in the same person under different circumstances, past and present health, age and gender impact how well a drug works.<br> &nbsp;<br> All effective drugs produce desirable changes in the body, but can also cause undesirable adverse reactions or side effects. Before you decide whether to take a drug, you or your doctor must decide, &#x201c;Will the benefits outweigh the risks?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In the United States, it is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure that drugs are safe and effective. For more information, you may contact the FDA at 1-888-INFO-FDA or visit the website: www.fda.gov.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Your Role</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Learn the generic names and brand names of all your medicines. For example, acetaminophen is the generic name for the brand Tylenol. Write them down to help you remember. If a drug is a combination, learn the names of its generic ingredients.<br> &nbsp;<br> Filling a Prescription<br> &nbsp;<br> Once a prescription is written you may purchase the medication from various sources. Pharmacies are usually located in a drug or grocery store. You may need to consider your options: Does your health insurance limit where prescriptions can be filled? Is the location convenient? Does the pharmacy maintain patient records and are the employees helpful and willing to answer drug related questions?<br> &nbsp;<br> Insurance companies or an HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) may specify certain pharmacies. Some insurance companies have chosen a mail-order pharmacy. Normally a prescription is sent to the mail-order pharmacy or phoned in by the physician. Mail order is best used for maintenance (long-term medications). Short-term medications such as antibiotics should be purchased at a local pharmacy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once a pharmacy has been chosen it is best to stay with that one so an accurate drug history can be maintained. The pharmacist can more easily check for drug interactions that may be potentially harmful to the patient or decrease the efficacy of one or more of the medications.<br> &nbsp;<br> You can phone the pharmacy for a refill. Provide the prescription number, name of medication, and name of the patient.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Taking A Drug</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Read the instructions provided with the drug and follow all directions for taking or using it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Never take medicine in the dark! Recheck the label before each use. You could be taking the wrong drug!<br> &nbsp;<br> Tell your doctor about any unexpected new symptoms you have while taking or using a drug. You may need to change drugs or have a dose adjustment.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Storage</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Keep all medicines out of children&#x2019;s reach and in childproof containers. Store drugs in a cool, dry place, such as a kitchen cabinet or bedroom. Avoid medicine cabinets in bathrooms. They get too moist and warm at times.<br> &nbsp;<br> Keep medicine in its original container, tightly closed. Don&#x2019;t remove the label! If directions call for refrigeration, keep the medicine cool, but don&#x2019;t freeze it.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Discarding</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Don&#x2019;t save leftover medicine to use later. Discard it on or before the expiration date shown on the container. Dispose safely to protect children and pets. See here.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Alertness</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Many of the medicines used to treat disorders may alter your alertness. If you drive, work around machinery, or must avoid sedation, discuss the problem with your doctor; usually there are ways (e.g., the time of day you take the medicine) to manage the problem.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Alcohol &amp; Medications</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Alcohol and drugs of abuse defeat the purpose of many medications. For example, alcohol causes depression; if you drink and are depressed, antidepressants will not relieve the depression. If you have a problem with drinking or drugs, discuss it with your doctor. There are ways to help.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Learn About Drugs</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Study the information in this book&#x2019;s charts regarding your medications. Read each chart completely. Because of space limitations, most information that fits more than one category appears only once. Any time you are prescribed a new medication, read the information on the chart for that drug, then take the time to review the charts on other medications you already take. Read any instruction sheets or printed warnings provided by your doctor or pharmacist.<br> &nbsp;<br><b> Drug Advertising</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Ads can cause confusion. Be sure and get sufficient information about any drug you think may help you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Be Safe! Tell Your Doctor</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Some suggestions for wise drug use apply to all drugs. Always give your doctor, dentist, or healthcare provider complete information about the drugs and supplements you take, including your medical history, your medical plans and your progress while under medication.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Medical History</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Tell the important facts of your medical history including illness and previous experience with drugs. Include allergic or adverse reactions you have had to any medicine or other substance in the past. Describe the allergic symptoms you have, such as hay fever, asthma, eye watering and itching, throat irritation and reactions to food. People who have allergies to common substances are more likely to develop drug allergies.<br> &nbsp;<br> List all drugs you take. Don&#x2019;t forget vitamin and mineral supplements; skin, rectal or vaginal medicines; eyedrops and eardrops; antacids; antihistamines; cold and cough remedies; inhalants and nasal sprays; aspirin, aspirin combinations or other pain relievers; motion sickness remedies; weight-loss aids; salt and sugar substitutes; caffeine; oral contraceptives; sleeping pills; laxatives; &#x201c;tonics&#x201d; or herbal preparations.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Future Medical Plans</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Discuss plans for elective surgery (including dental surgery), pregnancy and breastfeeding. These conditions may require discontinuing or modifying the dosages of medicines you may be taking.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Questions</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Don&#x2019;t hesitate to ask questions about a drug. Your doctor or pharmacist will be able to provide helpful information if they are familiar with you and your medical history.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Guide to Drug Charts</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The drug information in this book is organized in condensed, easy-to-read charts. Each drug is described in a two-page format, as shown in the sample chart below and opposite. Charts are arranged alphabetically by drug generic names, such as ACETAMINOPHEN or by drug class name, such as ANTIHISTAMINES.<br> &nbsp;<br> A generic name is the official chemical name for a drug. A brand name is a drug manufacturer&#x2019;s registered trademark for a generic drug. Brand names listed on the charts include those from the United States and Canada. A generic drug may have one, a few, or many brand names.<br> &nbsp;<br> To find information about a generic drug, look it up in the index. To learn about a brand name, check the index, where each brand name is followed by the name(s) of its generic ingredients and their chart page number(s).<br> &nbsp;<br> The chart design is the same for every drug. When you are familiar with the chart, you can quickly find information you want to know about a drug.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the next few pages, each of the numbered chart sections below is explained. This information will guide you in reading and understanding the charts that begin here.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>1&#x2014;Generic or Class Name</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Each drug chart is titled by generic name or by the name of the drug class, such as DIGITALIS PREPARATIONS.<br> &nbsp;<br> All drugs have a generic name. These generic names are the same worldwide. Sometimes a drug is known by more than one generic name. The chart is titled by the most common one. Less common generic names appear in parentheses. For example, vitamin C is also known as ascorbic acid. Its chart title is VITAMIN C (Ascorbic Acid). The index will include both names.<br> &nbsp;<br> Your drug container may show a generic name, a brand name or both. If you have only a brand name, use the index to find the drug&#x2019;s generic name(s) and chart page number(s).<br> &nbsp;<br> If your drug container shows no name, ask your doctor or pharmacist for the name and write it on the container.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>2&#x2014;Brand Names</b><br> &nbsp;<br> A brand name is usually shorter and easier to remember than the generic name. The brand name is selected by the drug manufacturer<br> &nbsp;<br> The brand names listed for each generic drug in this book do not include all brands available in the United States and Canada. The more common names are listed. New brands appear on the market, and brands are sometimes removed from the market. No list can reflect every change. In the instances in which the drug chart is titled with a drug class name instead of a generic name, the generic and brand names all appear under the heading GENERIC AND BRAND NAMES. The GENERIC NAMES are in capital letters and the BRAND NAMES are in lower-case letters.<br> &nbsp;<br> Inclusion of a brand name does not imply recommendation or endorsement. Exclusion does not imply that a missing brand name is less effective or less safe than the ones listed. Some drug charts have too many generic and brand names to list on the page. A complete list is on the page indicated on the chart.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lists of brand names don&#x2019;t differentiate between prescription and nonprescription drugs. The active ingredients are the same.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you buy a nonprescription drug, look for generic names of the active ingredients on the container. Common nonprescription drugs are described in this book under their generic components. Many are also listed in the index by brand name.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most drugs contain inert, or inactive, ingredients that are fillers, dyes or solvents for the active ingredients. Manufacturers choose inert ingredients that preserve the drug without interfering with the action of the active ingredients.<br> &nbsp;<br> Inert substances are listed on labels of nonprescription drugs. They do not appear on prescription drugs. Your pharmacist can tell you all active and inert ingredients in a prescription drug.<br> &nbsp;<br> A tablet, capsule or liquid may contain small amounts of sodium, sugar or potassium. If you are on a diet that severely restricts any of these, ask your pharmacist or doctor to suggest another form.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some liquid medications contain alcohol. Avoid them if you are susceptible to the adverse effects of alcohol consumption.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>BASIC INFORMATION</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>3&#x2014;Habit Forming?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Yes&#x2014;means the drug is capable of leading to physical and/or psychological dependence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Physical dependence includes tolerance (requiring larger dosages or repeated use) and withdrawal symptoms (mental and physical) when it is stopped.<br> &nbsp;<br> Psychological dependence involves repeated use of a drug to bring about effects that are pleasurable or satisfying, or it reduces undesirable feelings.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>4&#x2014;Prescription Needed?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Yes&#x2014;means a doctor must prescribe the drug for you. &#x201c;No&#x201d; means you can buy the drug without prescription. Sometimes low strengths of a drug are available without prescription, while higher strengths require prescription.<br> &nbsp;<br> The information about the drug applies whether it requires prescription or not. If the generic ingredients are the same, nonprescription drugs have the same dangers, warnings, precautions and interactions as prescription drugs. A nonprescription (over-the-counter) drug has dosing and other instructions printed on the container label. Always read them carefully before you take the drug. The information and warnings on containers for nonprescription drugs may not be as complete as the information in this book. Check both sources.<br> &nbsp;<br><b> 5&#x2014;Available as Generic?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Some drugs have patent restrictions that protect the manufacturer or distributor of that drug. These drugs may be purchased only by a specific brand name.<br> &nbsp;<br> Drugs purchased by generic name are usually less expensive than brand names. Once the patent expires, other drug companies can sell that particular drug. They will choose their own brand name.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some states allow pharmacists to fill a prescription by brand name or generic name (if available). This allows patients to buy the least expensive form of a drug.<br> &nbsp;<br> A doctor may specify a brand name because he or she trusts a known source more than an unknown manufacturer of generic drugs. You and your doctor should decide together whether you should buy a medicine by generic name or brand name.<br> &nbsp;<br> Generic drugs manufactured in other countries are not subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

What then, asks Jeremy D. Popkin in <i>History, Historians, and Autobiography</i>, are we to make of the ever-increasing number of professional historians who are publishing stories of their own lives? And how is this recent development changing the nature of history-writing, the historical profession, and the genre of autobiography?<br><br>Drawing on the theoretical work of contemporary critics of autobiography and the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur, Popkin reads the autobiographical classics of Edward Gibbon and Henry Adams and the memoirs of contemporary historians such as Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Peter Gay, Jill Ker Conway, and many others, he reveals the contributions historians' life stories make to our understanding of the human experience. Historians' autobiographies, he shows, reveal how scholars arrive at their vocations, the difficulties of writing about modern professional life, and the ways in which personal stories can add to our understanding of historical events such as war, political movements, and the traumas of the Holocaust. <br><br>An engrossing overview of the way historians view themselves and their profession, this work will be of interest to readers concerned with the ways in which we understand the past, as well as anyone interested in the art of life-writing.<br></p><p><b>Jeremy D. Popkin</b> is professor of history at the University of Kentucky and the author of six books, including<i> A Short History of the French Revolution.</i>"This is a wonderful study of autobiographies by historians. It is the first such book-length study, and it is composed with great analytic acuity and psychological insight. One of its many strengths is its sophisticated discussion of the recent theoretical literature on autobiography. Jeremy Popkin's method throughout is comparative, and his comparisons are ingenious." (Paul Robinson <i>Paul Robinson</i> 2004-10-04)<br><br>"Jeremy Popkin is like a physicist who, in order to study two phenomena, chooses to examine their point of intersection. Autobiographies of historians are a sort of experimental object in which one can observe how each of these two undertakings&#x2014;the act of writing history, and writing the history of that act&#x2014;reveals what is specific to the one when it is disturbed by the other, and how the two are similar. Perhaps ego-history, promoted by Pierre Nora, was not as new as Nora believed. What is new, on the other hand, is the analytical, perceptive, and sensitive treatment that Jeremy Popkin gives it here." (philippe LeJeune <i>Philippe LeJeune</i> 2005-01-24)<br><br>"Scholars of life writing and historians alike will welcome this ground-breaking study of the historical dimensions of autobiography. Jeremy Popkin's lively and engaging style and precise, nuanced analyses make a persuasive case for reading historians' autobiographies as engagements with the past that shed light on the current stakes of life writing. Exploring an impressive range of twentieth-century narratives, as well as earlier prototypes, Popkin deftly interweaves theoretical frameworks from life narrative and history. The result is an illuminating study at the intersection of two often contentious disciplines that puts them in productive and insightful conversation."

Christian trinitarian theology is accordingly interwoven with contemporary social thought to provide an account of individuality and of the various dimensions of personal existence (the psychological, the interpersonal, the material, the institutional, the political, the spiritual) in terms of communication. The basic theme of this book is that we become the people we are as our identities are shaped through the patterns of relation, communication and exchange that surround and incorporate us.</p><p>&#34;What is a person?&#34; Although the answer is given in largely theoretical terms, the primary concern of this volume is to identify the personal, social, and political practices required to live as a human in community with others.&#34;The value of this book lies in its detailed exploration of the implications for theology of an important current in contemporary thought....

Steven Skiena, a jai-alai enthusiast and computer scientist, documents how he used computer simulations and modeling techniques to predict the outcome of jai-alai matches and increased his initial stake by 544% in one year. Skiena demonstrates how his jai-alai system functions like a stock trading system, and includes examples of how gambling and mathematics interact in program trading systems, how mathematical models are used in political polling, and what the future holds for Internet gambling. With humor and enthusiasm, Skiena explains computer predictions used in business, sports, and politics, and the difference between correlation and causation. An unusual presentation of how mathematical models are designed, built, and validated, Calculated Bets also includes a list of modeling projects with online data sources. Steven Skiena, Associate Professor of Computer Science at SUNY Stony Brook, is the author of The Algorithm Design Manual (Springer-Verlag, 1997) and the EDUCOM award-winning Computational Discrete Mathematics. He is the recipient of the ONR Young Investigator&#39;s Award and the Chancellor&#39;s Award for Excellence in Teaching at Stony Brook. His research interests include discrete mathematics and its applications, particularly the design of graph, string, and geometric algorithms.</p><p>You could just as easily call this book <i>How to Bet at Jai-Alai and Win!</i> But that's only half the story. While <i>Calculated Bets</i> might indeed help you make a buck down at the fronton, it's as much concerned with the power of mathematical modeling and computer programming. The story of accomplished mathematician Steven Skiena's longtime obsession with this obscure Basque sport, <i>Calculated Bets</i> uses straightforward mathematics and real-world examples to divine the statistical mysteries behind playing--and, more important, wagering on--jai alai. (Which goes a long way toward explaining why Cambridge University Press is publishing what's basically a book about gambling.)<p> A self-styled "mild-mannered professor," the conversational Skiena (<i>The Algorithm Design Manual</i>) delivers on his book's many promises, from explaining how mathematical models are "designed, built, and validated" to providing lucid discussions of such topics as market efficiency and the difference between correlation and causation. Even better are his riffs on why real programmers hate Microsoft (hint: it's not jealousy) and the beauty behind interesting curves. In the end, Skiena even puts his money where his mouth is: using a modem, he sets loose an auto-dialing program called Maven that he and his grad students cooked up, sending it off in the wee hours of the morning to cull the Web for stats, play each match a half-million times, and then automatically wager a $250 stake. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>This book tells the story of how the author used computer simulations and mathematical modeling techniques to predict the outcome of jai-alai matches and bet on them successfully. The author weaves into this story other aspects of gambling and mathematics, discussing gambling systems, both successful and unsuccessful, for such games as lotto, roulette, blackjack, and Wall Street. From this book students will gain insight into what is really involved in building and validating a mathematical model and implementing it on a computer. For those who are inspired to want to build one themselves, a list of exciting modeling projects with data sources on the WWW is included to get them started.</p><h2>The Stechlin (Studies in German Literature Linguistics and Culture, 70)</h2><p>Theodor Fontane (1819-98), widely regarded as Germany&#39;s most significant novelist between Goethe and Thomas Mann, pioneered the German novel of manners and upper-class society, following a trend in European fiction of the period. The Stechlin is Fontane&#39;s last book and his political testament. Like Effi Briest, his great work on the place of women in Bismarck&#39;s empire, it is set at the apex of the Wilhelmine era, both in Berlin and on the estate of a Prussian Junker on the shores of Lake Stechlin. It is a significant historical and cultural document, probably the finest chronicle of the lifestyle of the German upper classes in the late nineteenth century; Fontane portrays the best in the life and ways of the passing Prussian aristocracy, while describing his hopes for the future of Germany and its nobility, which were never to be fully realized. Although this novel has been translated into many languages, it has never before been available in English; this edition thus fills an important gap in the significant works of European literature accessible to English readers.</p><p>Zwiebel has produced a masterpiece in this translation of Fontane&#39;s last major work.

White Fang is part wolf, part dog, a ferocious and magnificent creature through whose experiences we see and feel essential rhythms and patterns of life in the animal kingdom and among mankind as well.<br>It is, above all, a novel that keenly observes the extraordinary working of one of nature's greatest gifts to its creatures: the power to adapt.</p><p></p></p><h2>At the Heart of Freedom</h2><p><p>How can women create a meaningful and joyous life for themselves? Is it enough to be equal with men? In this provocative and wide-ranging book, Drucilla Cornell argues that women should transcend the quest for equality and focus on what she shows is a far more radical project: achieving freedom. Cornell takes us on a highly original exploration of what it would mean for women politically, legally, and culturally, if we took this ideal of freedom seriously--if, in her words, we recognized that "hearts starve as well as bodies." She takes forceful and sometimes surprising stands on such subjects as abortion, prostitution, pornography, same-sex marriage, international human rights, and the rights and obligations of fathers. She also engages with what it means to be free on a theoretical level, drawing on the ideas of such thinkers as Kant, Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, Hegel, and Lacan.</p><br><p> Cornell begins by discussing what she believes lies at the heart of freedom: the ability for all individuals to pursue happiness in their own way, especially in matters of love and sex. This is only possible, she argues, if we protect the "imaginary domain"--a psychic and moral space in which individuals can explore their own sources of happiness. She writes that equality with men does not offer such protection, in part because men themselves are not fully free. Instead, women must focus on ensuring that individuals face minimal interference from the state and from oppressive cultural norms. They must also respect some controversial individual choices. Cornell argues in favor of permitting same-sex couples to marry and adopt children, for example. She presses for access to abortion and for universal day care. She also justifies lifestyles that have not always been supported by other feminists, ranging from staying at home as a primary caregiver to engaging in prostitution. She argues that men should have similar freedoms--thus returning feminism to its promise that freedom for women would mean freedom for all.</p><br><p> Challenging, passionate, and powerfully argued, Cornell's book will have a major impact on the course of feminist thought.</p></p><p><p>"True to a revolutionary vision of feminist politics, in this courageous and fascinating book Drucilla Cornell challenges everyone to rethink feminist theory in ways that interrogate and transform the discourse so that it offers an inclusive paradigm for liberation."<b>--bell hooks</b></p><b>Drucilla Cornell</b> is Professor of Law, Political Science, and Women's Studies at Rutgers University.

By learning assembly language programming, you learn how the machine really operates and that knowledge will help you write better high-level language code. A dirty little secret assembly language programmers rarely admit to, however, is that what you really need to learn is machine organization, not assembly language programming. Write Great Code Vol I, the first in a series from assembly language expert Randall Hyde, dives right into machine organization without the extra overhead of learning assembly language programming at the same time. And since Write Great Code Vol I concentrates on the machine organization, not assembly language, the reader will learn in greater depth those subjects that are language-independent and of concern to a high level language programmer. Write Great Code Vol I will help programmers make wiser choices with respect to programming statements and data types when writing software, no matter which language they use.</p></p><p><p>Randall Hyde is the author of Write Great Code Volumes 1 and 2 (No Starch Press) and the co-author of MASM 6.0 Bible (The Waite Group). He has written for Dr. Dobb &#x2122;s Journal, Byte, and various professional journals.

Based on more than two years of ethnographic fieldwork among five thousand working-class families in the neighborhood of al-Zawyia al-Hamra, this study explores how these displaced residents have dealt with the stigma of public housing, the loss of their established community networks, and the diversity of the population in the new location.<br><br>Until now, few anthropologists have delivered detailed case studies on this recent phenomenon. Ghannam fills this gap in scholarship with an illuminating analysis of urban engineering of populations in Cairo. Drawing on theories of practice, the study traces the various tactics and strategies employed by members of the relocated group to appropriate and transform the state's understanding of "modernity" and hegemonic construction of space. Informed by recent theories of globalization, Ghannam also shows how the growing importance of religious identity is but one of many contradictory ways that global trajectories mold the identities of the relocated residents. Remaking the Modern is a revealing ethnography of a working class community's struggle to appropriate modern facilities and confront the alienation and the dislocation brought on by national policies and the quest to globalize Cairo.</p><p><b>Farha Ghannam</b> is Visiting Assistant Professor at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania.</p><h2>Inkle Weaving: A Comprehensive Manual</h2><p>Paperback book about weavingt</p><p></p><h2>Eyewitness Atlas of the World Revised</h2><p>Thoroughly updated to encompass the latest geographic and political changes, a colorful atlas of the world presents more than sixty full-color cartographic maps, some one thousand colorful charts and diagrams, and descriptions of the people, products, flora, and fauna of the world.</p><p>Part of growing up is learning how you fit in--to a family, a town, a country, and a larger world.

Then why another book? Most books about MySQL discuss a wide variety of topics, such as the installation of MySQL, using MySQL from PHP, and security. As a result, each topic cannot be explained in detail, and many questions of readers cannot be answered. This book focuses on one aspect of MySQL: the language that drives MySQL, which is <i>SQL</i> (Structured Query Language). Every developer working with MySQL should master this language thoroughly.</p> <p>Especially in the more recent versions, SQL has been extended considerably. Unfortunately, many developers still limit themselves to those features that were available in the first versions. Not all the features of MySQL are fully used, which means that the product is not employed in the best way possible. The result is that complex statements and programs must be built needlessly. When you buy a house, you also do not restrict yourself to 20 percent of the rooms, do you? That is why this book contains a complete and detailed description of the SQL dialect as implemented in MySQL version 5.0.18. It should be seen primarily as a textbook rather than as a reference book; it will teach you the language, and you can complete the exercises to test your knowledge. After reading this book, you should be familiar with all the statements and features and some idiosyncrasies of MySQL's SQL, and you should be able to use it efficiently and effectively.</p> <p><b>Topics</b></p> <p>This book is completely devoted to the SQL dialect as implemented in MySQL. It discusses every aspect of the language thoroughly and critically. These aspects of SQL among others, are covered:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Querying data (joins, functions, and subqueries)</p> </li> <li> <p>Updating data</p> </li> <li> <p>Creating tables and views</p> </li> <li> <p>Specifying primary and foreign keys and other integrity constraints </p> </li> <li> <p>Using indexes</p> </li> <li> <p>Considering data security</p> </li> <li> <p>Developing stored procedures and triggers</p> </li> <li> <p>Developing programs with PHP</p> </li> <li> <p>Working with transactions </p> </li> <li> <p>Using the catalog</p> </li> </ul> <p><b>For Whom Is This Book Intended?</b></p> <p>We recommend this book on MySQL's SQL dialect to those who want to use the full power of MySQL effectively and efficiently in practice. This book is therefore suitable for the following groups of people:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Developers</b> who develop applications with the help of MySQL</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Database managers </b>who have to know the possibilities and impossibilities of SQL</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Students</b> in higher education, including those in technical colleges, polytechnics, universities, and sixth-form colleges</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Designers, analysts,</b> and <b>consultants</b> who have to deal, directly or indirectly, with MySQL and/or SQL and want to know about its possibilities and impossibilities</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Home students</b> who are interested in MySQL and/or SQL</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Users </b>who have the authority to use SQL to query the MySQL database of the company or institute for which they are working</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Web site developers</b> who are creating web sites with the help of MySQL and languages such as PHP and Python</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>IT hobbyists</b> who are interested in MySQL and want to develop an SQL application using MySQL themselves</p> </li> </ul> <p><b>A Practical Book</b></p> <p>This book should be seen primarily as a <i>textbook</i> and less as a reference work. To this end, it contains many examples and exercises (with answers). Do not ignore the exercises. Experience shows that you will learn the language more thoroughly and more quickly by practicing often and doing many exercises.</p> <p><b>The Book's Web Site</b></p> <p>When you leaf through the book, you will come across numerous SQL statements. Sometimes these are examples, and sometimes they are answers to questions. After you have installed MySQL, you can run through these statements to see whether they work and see their effects. You could type in all the statements again like a real Spartan, but you can also make life easy for yourself by downloading all the statements from the Internet. A special web site for this book, http://www.r20.nl, includes all the SQL statements.</p> <p>We also have used the web site for these purposes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The web site includes an installation process and instructions for MySQL. You will find useful tips for installing MySQL under Windows. The site also explains the installation process of the example database.</p> </li> <li> <p>If an error is found in the book, the web site will rectify the mistake.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reader comments that could be of interest to others will be added periodically to site.</p> </li> <li> <p>We even will consider making additional chapters available on the web site in the future.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Therefore, keep an eye on this web site.</p> <p><b>Prerequisite Knowledge</b></p> <p>Some general knowledge of programming languages and database servers is required.</p> <p><b>The History of This Book</b></p> <p>It was 1984, and the database world was under the spell of a revolution. SQL had started its triumphal procession. Vendors such as IBM and Oracle had introduced the commercial versions of their SQL database servers, and the marketing machine went at full speed. The market reacted positively to this rise of first-generation SQL database servers. Many organizations decided to buy such a database server and gradually phase out their existing products.</p> <p>My employer at that time had decided to get involved in this tumult as well. The company also wanted to make money with this new database language, and the plan was to start organizing SQL courses. Because of my background knowledge, I was charged with this task. That SQL would become such a success and that my agreement to present the courses would have far- reaching consequences (personally as well as professionally) never entered my mind.</p> <p>After studying SQL closely, I started to develop the material for the course. After teaching SQL for two years with great pleasure, I got an idea to write a book about SQL. It would have to be a book completely dedicated to this language, with its many possibilities and idiosyncrasies.</p> <p>After producing gallons of blood, sweat, and tears, I completed the first Dutch edition in 1986, entitled <i>Het SQL Leerboek.</i> The book did not focus on a specific SQL database server, but on the SQL standard. Barely before the book was published, I was asked to write an English version. That book, <i>Introduction to SQL,</i> was published in 1987 as the first English book completely devoted to SQL. After that, I wrote versions in German and Italian. Obviously, a need existed for information about SQL. Everyone wanted to learn about SQL, but not much information was available.</p> <p>Because SQL was still young, development went fast. Statements were added, extended, and improved. New implementations became available, new application areas were discovered, and new versions of the SQL standard appeared. Soon a new edition of the book had to be written. And more was to come. And this will not be the last because SQL has gloriously won the revolution in the database world, and no competition is in sight on the horizon. </p> <p>Through the years, many vendors have implemented SQL. At first, all these products had much in common, but slowly the number of differences increased. For that reason, I decided in 2003 to write a book specifically dedicated to the SQL dialect of MySQL. I thought it would be a piece of cake. I would use <i>Introduction to SQL</i> as an example, add some details of MySQL, and remove a few general aspects. How long could that take? Two weeks of hard work and some speed typing, and I'd have the book ready. However, that appeared to be a serious underestimation. To give a complete view of all the features, I had to dive deeply into the SQL dialect of MySQL. This book, which definitely took more than two weeks of writing, is the result of that time-consuming effort. Obviously, it is related to the book from which it is derived; however, it contains many MySQL-related details not included in <i>Introduction to SQL.</i> </p> <p><b>And Finally...</b></p> <p>Writing this book was not a solo project. Many people have contributed to this book or previous editions. I would like to use this preface to thank them for their help, contributions, ideas, comments, mental support, and patience. </p> <p>It does not matter how many times a writer reads his own work; editors remain indispensable. A writer reads not what he has written, but what he thinks he has written. In this respect, writing is like programming. That is why I owe a great deal to the following persons for making critical comments and giving very helpful advice: Klaas Brant, Marc van Cappellen, Ian Cargill, Corine Cools, Richard van Dijk, Rose Endres, Wim Frederiks, Andrea Gray, Ed Jedeloo, Josien van der Laan, Oda van der Lans, Deborah Leendertse, Arjen Lentz, Onno de Maar, Andrea Maurino, Sandor Nieuwenhuijs, Henk Schreij, Dave Slayton, Aad Speksnijder, Nok van Veen, John Vicherek, and David van der Waaij. They all have read this manuscript (or parts of it) or the manuscript of a previous edition, a translation of it, or an adjusted version.</p> <p>I would like to thank Wim Frederiks and Roland Bouman separately for all the hours they spent editing this book. Both patiently studied each page and pointed out the errors and inconsistencies. I am very grateful to them for all the work they put into this project.</p> <p>I would also like to thank the thousands of students across the world whom I have taught SQL over the past years. Their comments and recommendations have been invaluable in revising this book. In addition, a large number of readers of the previous edition responded to my request to send comments and suggestions. I want to thank them for the trouble they took to put these in writing.</p> <p>From the first day I started working on the project, I had the support of the MySQL organization. They helped me by making the required software available. I want to thank this group very much for the support and help. </p> <p>Again, I owe Diane Cools many thanks. As an editor, she made this book readable to others. For a writer, it is also reassuring to find someone who, especially in difficult times, keeps stimulating and motivating you. Thanks, Diane!</p> <p>Finally, again I would like to ask readers to send comments, opinions, ideas, and suggestions concerning the contents of the book to sql@r20.nl, referencing <i>SQL for MySQL Developers.</i> Many thanks, in anticipation of your cooperation.</p> <p>Rick F. van der Lans <br>Den Haag, The Netherlands, March 2007</p> <br> <p>� Copyright Pearson Education.

Senator Moynihan begins by recounting the astonishing story of the Venona project, in which Soviet cables sent to the United States during World War II were decrypted by the U.S. Army&#x2015;but were never passed on to President Truman. The divisive Hiss perjury trial and the McCarthy era of suspicion might have had a far different impact on American society, says Moynihan, if government agencies had not kept secrets from one another as a means of shoring up their power. Moynihan points to many other examples of how government bureaucracies used secrecy to avoid public scrutiny and got into trouble as a result. He discusses the Bay of Pigs, Watergate, the Iran-Contra affair, and, finally, the failure to forecast the collapse of the Soviet Union, suggesting that many of the tragedies resulting from these events could have been averted had the issues been clarified in an open exchange of ideas. America must lead the way to an era of openness, says Moynihan in this vitally important book. It is time to dismantle the excesses of government secrecy and share information with our citizens and with the world. Analysis, far more than secrecy, is the key to national security. <br><br></p><p>Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY) was one of the first members of the United States government openly to predict the imminent collapse of the Soviet Union--and, by extension, statist communism--as far back as the late '70s, as political historian Richard Gid Powers reminds readers in a lengthy introduction (comprising approximately one-fifth of <i>Secrecy</i>'s total length). Had we spent less time trying to gather secret information about the Soviets and more time openly discussing rather easily interpretable data, Sen. Moynihan argues, we might have been far less paranoid about the supposed Red menace. The problem, he writes, lies in the essential nature of government secrecy: "Departments and agencies hoard information, and the government becomes a kind of market. Secrets become organizational assets, never to be shared save in exchange for another organization's assets.... The system costs can be enormous. In the void created by absent or withheld information, decisions are either made poorly or not at all."<p> Sen. Moynihan draws upon several incidents to make his point, from the Army's deliberate withholding from President Harry Truman of information about Soviet spy rings to the disastrous 1961 invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs to the Iran-Contra affair. The senator knows whereof he speaks; he was for eight years a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. <i>Secrecy</i> ably combines hands-on experience and historical perspective, calling for the United States to take advantage of the new era in international relations to implement policies that once again encourage the open, uninhibited flow of information among government agencies and, whenever possible, the public. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>Daniel Patrick Moynihan is the senior U.S. senator from New York.</p><h2>Essentials of Marketing Research</h2><p>Essentials of Marketing Research concisely delivers an up-to-date review of a broad variety of marketing research topics.

Indeed, with the collapse of manufacturing jobs in the 1970s, the area experienced a rapid onset of poverty and high unemployment, with few public resources available to alleviate economic distress. But in stark contrast to the image of a perpetual &#x201c;urban underclass&#x201d; depicted in television by shows like The Wire, sociologists Karl Alexander, Doris Entwisle, and Linda Olson present a more nuanced portrait of Baltimore&#x2019;s inner city residents that employs important new research on the significance of early-life opportunities available to low-income populations. The Long Shadow focuses on children who grew up in west Baltimore neighborhoods and others like them throughout the city, tracing how their early lives in the inner city have affected their long-term well-being. Although research for this book was conducted in Baltimore, that city&#x2019;s struggles with deindustrialization, white flight, and concentrated poverty were characteristic of most East Coast and Midwest manufacturing cities. The experience of Baltimore&#x2019;s children who came of age during this era is mirrored in the experiences of urban children across the nation. For 25 years, the authors of The Long Shadow tracked the life progress of a group of almost 800 predominantly low-income Baltimore school children through the Beginning School Study Youth Panel (BSSYP). The study monitored the children&#x2019;s transitions to young adulthood with special attention to how opportunities available to them as early as first grade shaped their socioeconomic status as adults. The authors&#x2019; fine-grained analysis confirms that the children who lived in more cohesive neighborhoods, had stronger families, and attended better schools tended to maintain a higher economic status later in life. As young adults, they held higher-income jobs and had achieved more personal milestones (such as marriage) than their lower-status counterparts. Differences in race and gender further stratified life opportunities for the Baltimore children. As one of the first studies to closely examine the outcomes of inner-city whites in addition to African Americans, data from the BSSYP shows that by adulthood, white men of lower status family background, despite attaining less education on average, were more likely to be employed than any other group in part due to family connections and long-standing racial biases in Baltimore&#x2019;s industrial economy. Gender imbalances were also evident: the women, who were more likely to be working in low-wage service and clerical jobs, earned less than men. African American women were doubly disadvantaged insofar as they were less likely to be in a stable relationship than white women, and therefore less likely to benefit from a second income. Combining original interviews with Baltimore families, teachers, and other community members with the empirical data gathered from the authors&#x2019; groundbreaking research, The Long Shadow unravels the complex connections between socioeconomic origins and socioeconomic destinations to reveal a startling and much-needed examination of who succeeds and why.</p></p><p>KARL ALEXANDER is John Dewey Professor of Sociology at Johns Hopkins University.

As such, the two analyses make possible some interesting critical thinking exercises focused on evaluation of the evidence used by the two historians. For Goldhagen, a chief reason for German actions was not the mundane good comradeship stressed by Browning, but a longstanding hatred of Jews and Judaism specific to Germany that dated back well into the previous century. Debating which historian is right, which has made better use of the available evidence, which has most successfully written objectively &#x2013; and which advances the most secure interpretation of contested documents &#x2013; forces students to think critically about one of the most important and (on the surface at least) incomprehensible events of the past century.</p></p><p><p><strong>Dr Simon Taylor</strong> holds a PhD in Modern History from&nbsp;Columbia University.

This is certainly not the first compilation of Twain witticisms. Nor is it the second or third. But of the 1,800-plus quotations included in <i>The Quotable Mark Twain</i>, more than half do not appear in any other collection. This is because the book's editor, R. Kent Rasmussen, is a committed Twain-ophile who has read and reread nearly everything Twain ever wrote. In these pages Rasmussen offers up Twain's trenchant and provocative words on such wide-ranging subjects as fried chicken ("the art cannot be learned north of the line of Mason and Dixon, nor anywhere in Europe"), Hinduism ("It is a good and gentle religion, but inconvenient"), the multiplication table ("that odious and confusing and unvanquishable and unlearnable and shameless invention"), and stealing ("It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected").

After teaching basic applied economics, the authors look inside the firm and apply this analysis to management decision making. </blockquote> <blockquote>Authors Brickley, Smith, and Zimmerman contend that organizational architecture consists of three aspects of corporate organization: the assignment of decision rights within the company; methods of rewarding individuals; the structure of systems to evaluate the performance of both individuals and business units. These three components can be likened to a stool with three legs. If one of the legs is shorter, the stool is out of balance. These three elements must be in balance in the organization as well. </blockquote></p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>The Best Read Naturalist&#34;: Nature Writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson (Under the Sign of Nature: Explorations in Environmental Humanities)</h2><p><p></p><p>Ralph Waldo Emerson is one of the most important figures in American nature writing, yet until now readers have had no book devoted to this central theme in his work. <i>"The Best Read Naturalist"</i> fills this lacuna, placing several of Emerson&#x2019;s lesser-known pieces of nature writing in conversation with his canonical essays. Organized chronologically, the thirteen selections&#x2015;made up of sermons, lectures, addresses, and essays&#x2015;reveal an engagement with natural history that spanned Emerson&#x2019;s career. As we watch him grapple with what he called the "book of nature," a more environmentally connected thinker emerges&#x2015;a "green" Emerson deeply concerned with the physical world and fascinated with the ability of science to reveal a correspondence between the order of nature and that of the mind. "The Best Read Naturalist" illuminates the vital influence that the study of natural history had on the development of Emerson&#x2019;s mature philosophy.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Michael P.

What they reveal is an Emerson who registered the beauty of nature in incomparable prose, who thought his day was incomplete without a walk in the woods, and who based his new philosophy of life on the findings of natural science&#x2015;certain that the true Poet was the prophet who could marry science with the sacred.

Toward this end, special care has been taken with regard to the order of presentation. After a brief chapter on the stroke order of kanji, the complete set of 1,945 Joyo Kanji, the "common use" characters listed by the Japanese Ministry of Education in 1981, will be introduced in three categories, one chapter for each, in the following sequence. </p><p>1. Basic-form kanji. These are 152 independent kanji that, having originated in unitary pictures or signs, cannot be analyzed into components. If one becomes familiar with these first, complex kanji that include them will be easier to learn later. </p><p>2. Semantic compound kanji. These are kanji made up of some combination of two or more basic forms or components that would have been basic forms had they not lost their status as independent kanji (at least as far as the J~y~ Kanji are concerned). The 483 kanji in this chapter are made of components that together suggest the meaning of the kanji (although a few of them also have characteristics of the third, phonetic, category). The emphasis of this chapter is thus on the association of meanings with forms. </p><p>3. Phonetic compound kanji. These are kanji that can be analyzed into a meaning-representing (or semantic) component and a sound-representing (or phonetic) component. Although most of the phonetic components have, or at least had, their own semantic significance as well, this chapter emphasizes the relationship between the phonetic components and the on-yomi of the 1,310 kanji listed. </p><p>Within the chapters on semantic and phonetic compound kanji, the characters are presented in an order that builds upon kanji and components previously introduced. </p><p>Whenever possible, we list the surmised earliest meanings of the kanji. Among the later variations on the meanings, we concentrate on those that are relevant to modern Japanese. Occasionally it is noted that a meaning applies only to Japanese, particularly when a peculiar usage in Japanese seems unrelated to the Chinese history of the kanji.</p></p><p>Yaeko S.

Its purpose is to provide information on the structure of both individual kanji (Chinese characters) and kanji compounds, to enable the student to study kanji systematically. We have Limited ourselves to the 1,945 Joyo Kanji (a list of "common use" characters selected by the Japanese Ministry of Education in 1981), feeling that a mastery of these would provide a strong background in the subject. </p><p>The book has been designed, not as a textbook in the strict sense, but rather as a reference book for students just beginning to study kanji and for more advanced students who feel they need to review systematically what they have learned. The nature of the content precluded ordering the presentation of kanji from most to least common, or in any such way as to coincide with the student's acquisition of vocabulary.

Here is Steinbeck&#x2019;s dramatic adaptation of his novel-as-play, which received the New York Drama Critics&#x2019; Circle Award for Best Play in 1937-1938 and has featured a number of actors who have played the iconic roles of George and Lennie on stage and film, including James Earl Jones, John Malkovich and Gary Sinise.From the Nobel Prize-winning author of <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> and <i>East of Eden</i>, this classic story of an unlikely pair, two migrant workers in California during the Great Depression who grasp for their American Dream, profoundly touches readers and audiences alike. George and his simple-minded friend Lenny dream, as drifters will, of a place to call their own&#x2014;a couple of acres and a few pigs, chickens, and rabbits back in Hill Country where land is cheap. But after they come to work on a ranch in the fertile Salinas Valley of California, their hopes, like &#x201c;the best laid schemes o&#x2019;mice an&#x2019; men,&#x201d; begin to go awry.<p><i>Of Mice and Men</i> also represents an experiment in form, as Steinbeck described his work, &#x201c;a kind of playable novel, written in novel form but so scened and set that it can be played as it stands.&#x201d; A rarity in American letters, it achieved remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films.</p></p><p><b>John Steinbeck</b>, born in Salinas, California, in 1902, grew up in a fertile agricultural valley, about twenty-five miles from the Pacific Coast. Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel, <b>Cup of Gold</b> (1929). <p> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books, <b>The Pastures of Heaven</b> (1932) and <b>To a God Unknown</b> (1933), and worked on short stories later collected in <b>The Long Valley</b> (1938). Popular success and financial security came only with <b>Tortilla Flat </b>(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class: <b>In Dubious Battle</b> (1936), <b>Of Mice and Men</b> (1937), and the book considered by many his finest, <b>The Grapes of Wrath</b> (1939). <b>The Grapes of Wrath</b> won both the <b>National Book Award</b> and the <b>Pulitzer Prize</b> in 1939.</p><p>Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with <b>The Forgotten Village</b> (1941) and a serious student of marine biology with <b>Sea of Cortez</b> (1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette <b>The Moon is Down</b> (1942). <b>Cannery Row</b> (1945), <b>The Wayward Bus</b> (1948), another experimental drama, <b>Burning Bright</b> (1950), and <b>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</b> (1951) preceded publication of the monumental <b>East of Eden</b> (1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history. </p><p>The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include <b>Sweet Thursday</b> (1954), <b>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</b> (1957), <b>Once There Was a War </b>(1958), <b>The Winter of Our Discontent </b>(1961), <b>Travels with Charley in Search of America </b>(1962), <b>America and Americans</b> (1966), and the posthumously published <b>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</b> (1969), <b>Viva Zapata!</b> (1975), <b>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</b> (1976), and <b>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</b> (1989). </p><p>Steinbeck received the <b>Nobel Prize in Literature</b> in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the <b>United States Medal of Freedom</b> by President Lyndon B.

But scientists now find changes in forest cover dramatically accelerated by such human activities as large-scale agriculture, the building of dams and roads, and the growth of cities with vast areas of asphalt. Changes that once took centuries now take only decades. Seeing the Forest and the Trees examines changes in land cover and land use in forested regions as major contributors to global environmental change. It investigates why some forested areas thrive even in the presence of high human densities and activity while others decline and disappear. The book brings together findings from an ongoing, large-scale, multidisciplinary research project undertaken by anthropologists, geographers, economists, sociologists, political scientists, environmental scientists, and biologists in more than twelve countries at over eighty locations. After addressing theory and methodology, including chapters on satellite remote sensing, geographic information systems, and modeling of land-cover change, the book presents case studies that compare data across sites and across temporal and spatial scales. It contributes to Human Dimensions in Global Change research and proposes new directions for this area of study.</p></p><p>Emilio F.

Appearing on one side was a radicalised version of the French constitution. On the other side was the theory of royal absolutism systematically developed by Bodin. The central thesis of this book is that Bodin&#39;s absolutism was as unprecedented as the doctrine it opposed. Prior to the 1570s the mainstream of the French tradition had been tentatively constitutionalist and Bodin himself had given strong expression to that tendency in his Methodus of 1566. His earlier theory of sovereignty, elaborated in that work, was implicitly adapted to a notion of limited supremacy. Professor Franklin&#39;s aim is to explain how this absolutist view was formed. In doing so, he has clarified many of the notorious obscurities in Bodin&#39;s thought and since much of the absolutist doctrine of the seventeenth century was either based on Bodin&#39;s theory or relied on similar assumptions, this study will be of great importance and interest to scholars of a later period.</p><p>The St Bartholomew&#39;s Day Massacre of 1572 polarised French constitutional ideas.

Along the way we witness him making his first toys, learn the origins of the Christmas tree and Christmas stockings, and discover the stories behind many Christmas secrets, like why Santa slides down chimneys, how he picks his reindeer, and how he delivers all his toys in one night. Later adapted into multiple animated films, and published here with the original illustrations from the first edition,&nbsp;<i>The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus</i>&nbsp;evinces the charm, warmth, and fantasy that made L.

Nurse used to sing of it when I was a child. She sang of the big tree-trunks, standing close together, with their roots intertwining below the earth and their branches intertwining above it; of their rough coating of bark and queer, gnarled limbs; of the bushy foliage that roofed the entire forest, save where the sunbeams found a path through which to touch the ground in little spots and to cast weird and curious shadows over the mosses, the lichens and the drifts of dried leaves.</p><p>The Forest of Burzee is mighty and grand and awesome to those who steal beneath its shade. Coming from the sunlit meadows into its mazes it seems at first gloomy, then pleasant, and afterward filled with never-ending delights.</p><p>For hundreds of years it has flourished in all its magnificence, the silence of its inclosure unbroken save by the chirp of busy chipmunks, the growl of wild beasts and the songs of birds.</p><p>Yet Burzee has its inhabitants&#x2014;for all this. Nature peopled it in the beginning with Fairies, Knooks, Ryls and Nymphs. As long as the Forest stands it will be a home, a refuge and a playground to these sweet immortals, who revel undisturbed in its depths.</p><p>Civilization has never yet reached Burzee. Will it ever, I wonder?</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER SECOND</p><p>The Child of the Forest</p><p>Once, so long ago our great-grandfathers could scarcely have heard it mentioned, there lived within the great Forest of Burzee a wood-nymph named Necile. She was closely related to the mighty Queen Zurline, and her home was beneath the shade of a widespreading oak. Once every year, on Budding Day, when the trees put forth their new buds, Necile held the Golden Chalice of Ak to the lips of the Queen, who drank therefrom to the prosperity of the Forest. So you see, she was a nymph of some importance, and, moreover, it is said she was highly regarded because of her beauty and grace.</p><p>When she was created she could not have told; Queen Zurline could not have told; the great Ak himself could not have told. It was long ago when the world was new and nymphs were needed to guard the forests and to minister to the wants of the young trees. Then, on some day not remembered, Necile sprang into being; radiant, lovely, straight and slim as the sapling she was created to guard.</p><p>Her hair was the color that lines a chestnut-bur; her eyes were blue in the sunlight and purple in the shade; her cheeks bloomed with the faint pink that edges the clouds at sunset; her lips were full red, pouting and sweet. For costume she adopted oak-leaf green; all the wood-nymphs dress in that color and know no other so desirable. Her dainty feet were sandal-clad, while her head remained bare of covering other than her silken tresses.</p><p>Necile&#x2019;s duties were few and simple. She kept hurtful weeds from growing beneath her trees and sapping the earth-food required by her charges. She frightened away the Gadgols, who took evil delight in flying against the tree-trunks and wounding them so that they drooped and died from the poisonous contact. In dry seasons she carried water from the brooks and pools and moistened the roots of her thirsty dependents.</p><p>That was in the beginning. The weeds had now learned to avoid the forests where wood-nymphs dwelt; the loathsome Gadgols no longer dared come nigh; the trees had become old and sturdy and could bear the drought better than when fresh-sprouted. So Necile&#x2019;s duties were lessened, and time grew laggard, while succeeding years became more tiresome and uneventful than the nymph&#x2019;s joyous spirit loved.</p><p>Truly the forest-dwellers did not lack amusement. Each full moon they danced in the Royal Circle of the Queen. There were also the Feast of Nuts, the Jubilee of Autumn Tintings, the solemn ceremony of Leaf Shedding and the revelry of Budding Day. But these periods of enjoyment were far apart, and left many weary hours between.</p><p>That a wood-nymph should grow discontented was not thought of by Necile&#x2019;s sisters. It came upon her only after many years of brooding. But when once she had settled in her mind that life was irksome she had no patience with her condition, and longed to do something of real interest and to pass her days in ways hitherto undreamed of by forest nymphs. The Law of the Forest alone restrained her from going forth in search of adventure.</p><p>While this mood lay heavy upon pretty Necile it chanced that the great Ak visited the Forest of Burzee and allowed the wood-nymphs&#x2014;as was their wont&#x2014;to lie at his feet and listen to the words of wisdom that fell from his lips. Ak is the Master Woodsman of the world; he sees everything, and knows more than the sons of men.</p><p>That night he held the Queen&#x2019;s hand, for he loved the nymphs as a father loves his children; and Necile lay at his feet with many of her sisters and earnestly harkened as he spoke.</p><p>&#x201c;We live so happily, my fair ones, in our forest glades,&#x201d; said Ak, stroking his grizzled beard thoughtfully, &#x201c;that we know nothing of the sorrow and misery that fall to the lot of those poor mortals who inhabit the open spaces of the earth. They are not of our race, it is true, yet compassion well befits beings so fairly favored as ourselves. Often as I pass by the dwelling of some suffering mortal I am tempted to stop and banish the poor thing&#x2019;s misery. Yet suffering, in moderation, is the natural lot of mortals, and it is not our place to interfere with the laws of Nature.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nevertheless,&#x201d; said the fair Queen, nodding her golden head at the Master Woodsman, &#x201c;it would not be a vain guess that Ak has often assisted these hapless mortals.&#x201d;</p><p>Ak smiled.</p><p>&#x201c;Sometimes,&#x201d; he replied, &#x201c;when they are very young&#x2014;&#x2018;children,&#x2019; the mortals call them&#x2014;I have stopped to rescue them from misery. The men and women I dare not interfere with; they must bear the burdens Nature has imposed upon them. But the helpless infants, the innocent children of men, have a right to be happy until they become full-grown and able to bear the trials of humanity. So I feel I am justified in assisting them. Not long ago&#x2014;a year, maybe&#x2014;I found four poor children huddled in a wooden hut, slowly freezing to death. Their parents had gone to a neighboring village for food, and had left a fire to warm their little ones while they were absent. But a storm arose and drifted the snow in their path, so they were long on the road. Meantime the fire went out and the frost crept into the bones of the waiting children.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Poor things!&#x201d; murmured the Queen softly. &#x201c;What did you do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I called Nelko, bidding him fetch wood from my forests and breathe upon it until the fire blazed again and warmed the little room where the children lay. Then they ceased shivering and fell asleep until their parents came.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am glad you did thus,&#x201d; said the good Queen, beaming upon the Master; and Necile, who had eagerly listened to every word, echoed in a whisper: &#x201c;I, too, am glad!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And this very night,&#x201d; continued Ak, &#x201c;as I came to the edge of Burzee I heard a feeble cry, which I judged came from a human infant. I looked about me and found, close to the forest, a helpless babe, lying quite naked upon the grasses and wailing piteously. Not far away, screened by the forest, crouched Shiegra, the lioness, intent upon devouring the infant for her evening meal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And what did you do, Ak?&#x201d; asked the Queen, breathlessly.</p><p>&#x201c;Not much, being in a hurry to greet my nymphs. But I commanded Shiegra to lie close to the babe, and to give it her milk to quiet its hunger. And I told her to send word throughout the forest, to all beasts and reptiles, that the child should not be harmed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am glad you did thus,&#x201d; said the good Queen again, in a tone of relief; but this time Necile did not echo her words, for the nymph, filled with a strange resolve, had suddenly stolen away from the group.</p><p>Swiftly her lithe form darted through the forest paths until she reached the edge of mighty Burzee, when she paused to gaze curiously about her. Never until now had she ventured so far, for the Law of the Forest had placed the nymphs in its inmost depths.</p><p>Necile knew she was breaking the Law, but the thought did not give pause to her dainty feet. She had decided to see with her own eyes this infant Ak had told of, for she had never yet beheld a child of man. All the immortals are full-grown; there are no children among them. Peering through the trees Necile saw the child lying on the grass. But now it was sweetly sleeping, having been comforted by the milk drawn from Shiegra. It was not old enough to know what peril means; if it did not feel hunger it was content.</p><p>Softly the nymph stole to the side of the babe and knelt upon the sward, her long robe of rose leaf color spreading about her like a gossamer cloud. Her lovely countenance expressed curiosity and surprise, but, most of all, a tender, womanly pity. The babe was new-born, chubby and pink. It was entirely helpless. While the nymph gazed the infant opened its eyes, smiled upon her, and stretched out two dimpled arms. In another instant Necile had caught it to her breast and was hurrying with it through the forest paths.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER THIRD</p><p>The Adoption</p><p>The Master Woodsman suddenly rose, with knitted brows. &#x201c;There is a strange presence in the Forest,&#x201d; he declared. Then the Queen and her nymphs turned and saw standing before them Necile, with the sleeping infant clasped tightly in her arms and a defiant look in her deep blue eyes.</p><p>And thus for a moment they remained, the nymphs filled with surprise and consternation, but the brow of the Master Woodsman gradually clearing as he gazed intently upon the beautiful immortal who had wilfully broken the Law. Then the great Ak, to the wonder of all, laid his hand softly on Necile&#x2019;s flowing locks and kissed her on her fair forehead.</p><p>&#x201c;For the first time within my knowledge,&#x201d; said he, gently, &#x201c;a nymph has defied me and my laws; yet in my heart can I find no word of chiding. What is your desire, Necile?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me keep the child!&#x201d; she answered, beginning to tremble and falling on her knees in supplication.</p><p>&#x201c;Here, in the Forest of Burzee, where the human race has never yet penetrated?&#x201d; questioned Ak.</p><p>&#x201c;Here, in the Forest of Burzee,&#x201d; replied the nymph, boldly. &#x201c;It is my home, and I am weary for lack of occupation. Let me care for the babe! See how weak and helpless it is. Surely it can not harm Burzee nor the Master Woodsman of the World!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But the Law, child, the Law!&#x201d; cried Ak, sternly.</p><p>&#x201c;The Law is made by the Master Woodsman,&#x201d; returned Necile; &#x201c;if he bids me care for the babe he himself has saved from death, who in all the world dare oppose me?&#x201d; Queen Zurline, who had listened intently to this conversation, clapped her pretty hands gleefully at the nymph&#x2019;s answer.</p><p>&#x201c;You are fairly trapped, O Ak!&#x201d; she exclaimed, laughing. &#x201c;Now, I pray you, give heed to Necile&#x2019;s petition.&#x201d;</p><p>The Woodsman, as was his habit when in thought, stroked his grizzled beard slowly. Then he said:</p><p>&#x201c;She shall keep the babe, and I will give it my protection. But I warn you all that as this is the first time I have relaxed the Law, so shall it be the last time. Never more, to the end of the World, shall a mortal be adopted by an immortal. Otherwise would we abandon our happy existence for one of trouble and anxiety. Good night, my nymphs!&#x201d;</p><p>Then Ak was gone from their midst, and Necile hurried away to her bower to rejoice over her newfound treasure.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER FOURTH</p><p>Claus</p><p>Another day found Necile&#x2019;s bower the most popular place in the Forest. The nymphs clustered around her and the child that lay asleep in her lap, with expressions of curiosity and delight. Nor were they wanting in praises for the great Ak&#x2019;s kindness in allowing Necile to keep the babe and to care for it. Even the Queen came to peer into the innocent childish face and to hold a helpless, chubby fist in her own fair hand.</p><p>&#x201c;What shall we call him, Necile?&#x201d; she asked, smiling. &#x201c;He must have a name, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let him be called Claus,&#x201d; answered Necile, &#x201c;for that means &#x2018;a little one.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rather let him be called Neclaus,&#x201d;* returned the Queen, &#x201c;for that will mean &#x2018;Necile&#x2019;s little one.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>The nymphs clapped their hands in delight, and Neclaus became the infant&#x2019;s name, although Necile loved best to call him Claus, and in afterdays many of her sisters followed her example.</p><p>Necile gathered the softest moss in all the forest for Claus to lie upon, and she made his bed in her own bower. Of food the infant had no lack. The nymphs searched the forest for bell-udders, which grow upon the goa-tree and when opened are found to be filled with sweet milk. And the soft-eyed does willingly gave a share of their milk to support the little stranger, while Shiegra, the lioness, often crept stealthily into Necile&#x2019;s bower and purred softly as she lay beside the babe and fed it.</p><p></p></p><h2>Scientific American Nutrition for a Changing World (Preliminary Edition) - Standalone book</h2><p><strong>NOTE: This is a standalone book and will not include an access code.</strong><br><br>In this breakthrough introductory text, educators Jamie Pope and Steve Nizielski, and science writer, Alison McCook use real stories&#x2014;about real people and real science&#x2014;to teach the basic concepts of nutrition.

In this book she has created a visual anthology of fairgoers and fair participants of all shapes and sizes. For five summers, she traveled the Midwest chronicling the rural life of the region - parades of civic pride, displays of exemplary harvests, and heifers and swine groomed by the Future Farmers of America. The photographer's journey takes us to North Dakota, Minnesota, Tennessee, Kansas, Mississippi, among other states. She stops along the way at peculiar, yet somehow familiar, communities.<br>In her introduction, Karal Ann Marling provides fascinating insights into Pratt's photos of county fair rituals and the regional culture that inspires these gatherings. She says: "They are home-made, do-it-yourself events, festivals of and by the towns and the counties from which they spring.... Along with old-timer reunions, centennials, and annual store-front festivals, fairs celebrate what it means to be an insider." Together Pratt and Marling transport the reader to a nostalgic yet contemporary custom, to a place where prize-winning hogs, tap-dancing children, flag-waving, and mouth-watering apple pie are once again American pastimes.</p><p>In the general introduction to these first two books in the National Museum of American Art's new series, "American Scene," the series editor and series curator express a hope to "present the evolving portrait of America" in a time when "the myth of the 'melting pot' has given way to a social fabric woven into a 'coat of many colors.' " While that noble dream is well on its way to being realized here, the reality still does not quite feel like art. The work of Bernice Abbott and Robert Frank, referred to in the introduction, provides insights into American life but is also characterized by a particular way of seeing. These books have less the effect of art than of photojournalism-though perhaps the best sort, one encouraging contemplation rather than sensationalism. Unfortunately, the problem lies largely in the nature of series, the constraints of size and format and introduction, which here places as much weight on the editors' vision as the individual photographer's ability to see. That said, these are nonetheless valuable documents of today's middle America, by turns pleasant and disturbing, honest, and mythical. Pratt focuses on the county fairs of the Midwest, the traditions they maintain, and, most importantly, the people who attend them. Arndt photographs men, mostly working class, mostly in crumbling cities, establishing a sense of unity among his subjects that makes it the more successful of the books. In these two multiple-image portraits, public libraries will find a moving record of fading people and their traditions.<br><i>Eric Bryant, "Library Journal"</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc."Greta Pratt's extraordinary photographs capture with beautiful precision the people of rural America. -- <i>Howard Zinn, January 2005</i><br><br>"Pratt's pictures amuse without indulging any condescending mockery.

The authors detail the journey of African Americans from their origin in the civilizations of Africa, through slavery in the Western Hemisphere, to the successful struggle for freedom in the West Indies, Latin America, and the U.S. This edition has been revised to include expanded coverage of Africa and two four-page color inserts. 60 illustrations and 4 maps.</p><p>This is the dramatic, exciting, authoritative story of the experiences of African Americans from the time they left Africa to their continued struggle for equality at the end of the twentieth century.<br><br>Since its original publication in 1947, <b>From Slavery to Freedom</b> has stood as the definitive his-tory of African Americans. Coauthors John Hope Franklin and Alfred A. Moss, Jr., give us a vividly detailed account of the journey of African Americans from their origins in the civilizations of Africa, through their years of slavery in the New World, to the successful struggle for freedom and its aftermath in the West Indies, Latin America, and the United States.<br><br>This eighth edition has been revised to include expanded coverage of Africa; additional material in every chapter on the history and current situation of African Americans in the United States; new charts, maps, and black-and-white illustrations; and a third four-page color insert. The authors incorporate recent scholarship to examine slavery, the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the period between World War I and World War II (including the Harlem Renaissance). <b>From Slavery to Freedom</b> describes the rise of slavery, the interaction of European and African cultures in the New World, and the emergence of a distinct culture and way of life among slaves and free blacks. The authors examine the role of blacks in the nation's wars, the rise of an articulate, restless free black community by the end of the eighteenth century, and the growing resistance to slavery among an expanding segment of the black population. <br> <br>The book deals in considerable detail with the period after slavery, including the arduous struggle for first-class citizenship that has extended into the twentieth century. Many developments in recent African American history are examined, including demographic change; educational efforts; literary and cultural changes; problems in housing, health, juvenile matters, and poverty; the expansion of the black middle class; and the persistence of discrimination in the administration of justice. <br><br>All who are interested in African Americans' continuing quest for equality will find a wealth of information based on the recent findings of many scholars. Professors Franklin and Moss have captured the tragedies and triumphs, the hurts and joys, the failures and successes, of blacks in a lively and readable volume that remains the most authoritative and comprehensive book of its kind.Alfred Moss received his Masters and Doctorate at the University of Chicago. He is a graduate of the Episcopal Divinity School, he is also an Episcopal priest.

During the Balkan wars of 1912&#x2013;1913, regional fighting in southeastern Europe ignited conflict across the continent that continued through both world wars and the Cold War.<br><br>In <i>Consumed by War: European Conflict in the 20th Century</i>, Richard C. Hall illuminates the complex diplomatic and military struggles of a region whose instability, rooted in a nineteenth-century nationalistic fervor, provided a catalyst for the political events that ensued. From the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 to the incarceration of Radovan Karadzic in 2008, this narrative history appeals to general readers and scholars interested in a fresh interpretation of a complicated and brutal era.</p><p><b>Richard C. Hall</b>, professor of history at Georgia Southwestern State University, is the author of <i>Bulgaria's Road to the First World War</i> and <i>The Balkan Wars, 1912&#x2013;1913: Prelude to the First World War.</i>"Hall combines fast-paced narrative and perspective analysis to make a case for a common thread in the series of wars that dominated and shaped twentieth century Europe. From the Great War through World War II and the Cold War, nationalism and ideology kept settlements fragile and peace elusive. The long conflict eventually facilitated the development of European unity and identity. But the price was bitterly high, and some bills remain outstanding."&#x2015;Dennis Showalter, author of<i> Patton and Rommel: Men of War in the Twentieth Century</i><p>"Hall handles deftly the complex elements of this catastrophic war."&#x2015;Malcolm Muir Jr., Director, John A.

Finding True Magic and the Transpersonal Hypnotherapy/NLP trainings are appropriate for laypeople seeking personal growth, as well as for therapists and other professionals intent on advancing their therapeutic skills. In fact, about 50 per cent of ITL students take the training primarily for personal development.</p><p>This book explores the possibilities for recognizing and freeing ourselves from a destructive process of perceiving, thinking, and acting that can be viewed as a pernicious worldwide epidemic. Unlike other diseases, which we strive to isolate and cure, this insidious fever has a characteristic that makes us blind to its presence: we come to identify its symptoms as our very own true self. We lovingly speak of this disease as our ego, our sense of limited separate selfhood. Jack Elias calls it "egoic-minding," because it is a process, not a thing.</p><p>Egoic-minding is a fragmented, biased way of perceiving and thinking. It can be viewed as a sort of destructive hypnotic trance that causes us to experience each other as strangers, as different, as threats. The delirium of this trance causes us to do violence to each other and to our world, without ever recognizing that it (our egoic thought process) is the true enemy.</p><p>By synthesizing insights and techniques of Eastern and Western philosophy and psychology, Finding True Magic explores various ways to disperse the feverish trance of egoic-minding, heal the trauma it causes, and wake us up to the sacred magic of our true Self. This true inner Self is the wellspring of our capacity for cooperation, community-building, and the celebration of life.</p><p>Everyone has the right to the make use of the essential insights and dynamics of healing communication, without resorting to the long-term expense of a professional intermediary. The model of such therapeutic relationships has changed in recent years, due to the financial burdens it places on our medical system. Financial considerations aside, however, therapy and therapists should change simply because there is a more effective approach to healing and personal growth.</p><p>That approach, which is the subject of this book, relies on the inherent goodness of our shared Being, a resource that is surprisingly easy to contact in the space between egoic thoughts. Most of us do not experience that space in the normal course of our thinking, however. We may be surprised to hear such a thing, given our experience of the seemingly impenetrable stream of our thoughts. But this space is quite real. It is the space of Silence, Healing Power, and Insight.</p><p>We have all experienced this silence on occasion, perhaps through prayer, or in a tender moment of love or awe. Most of us have not been taught, and have remained unaware that this silent Presence is always so close and available. Holistic mind/body therapeutic techniques, such as those presented here, derive transformative power when they help us to tap into this willing Presence, also called Grace.</p></p><p><p>My approach to hypnotherapy is transpersonal. I believe that the client's goal, whether or not she realizes it consciously, is to be whole and at peace with herself all the time. Attaining this wholeness and peace is my intention working with clients and students.</p> <p>In my view, this intention must be contemplated by prospective hypnotherapists with passion, curiosity, and perseverance. Their success with clients will be directly proportionate to how deeply they cultivate this contemplation and make it relevant to their own secret inner life.</p> <p>To be passionate and curious, contemplation of this sort must be free of any standard of success. You must be free of fear or hope that you will or will not be successful.You must do such contemplation purely for the sake of learning...learning for its own sake...discovering that even so-called success or failure is merely a label for a certain kind of learning whose fundamental value lies beyond these conditioned judgments. Learning is a whole body/being process.</p> <p>To be fully engaged in the process of learning is to be fully alive, moment by moment. To experience being fully alive is the ultimate goal of this course&#x2015;to be awake, free from all trances of the egoic mind.</p> (Jack Elias)<p><b>Jack Elias</b> is an internationally respected Transpersonal Hypnotherapy and NLP trainer and coach since 1988.

This is a must have reference for the beginner as well as the experienced trader. After years of study, I gained one new very profitable insight from Chapters 2 and 3."&#x2014;Jim Twentyman, President, Custom Charts</p> <p>Every trader has one simple wish: to be able to predict the future of the markets. Many forecasting methods have been used over the years, but none has ever been quite as reliable or effective as Gann Theory. In this groundbreaking new book, James A. Hyerczyk's exhaustive examination of this complex theory and its underlying tenets offers an unprecedented first-time look at the intricacies of incorporating Gann Theory tools into real-time trading systems.</p> <p>A popular, but often misunderstood and misused charting method, Gann Theory was developed by one of the first and most successful technical market analysts&#x2014;and one of the most controversial figures in the field. A brilliant mathematician, W. D. Gann was widely known for his sharp analytical skills, revolutionary ideas, and unrelenting determination to create a perfect trading system. Endowed with an uncanny ability to foresee events, he shared this unique talent by issuing annual market predictions of major moves and exact support and resistance levels. Prophetically, in 1929, he even warned traders of an upcoming crash: "September&#x2014;one of the sharpest declines of the year is indicated. . . .</p> <p>A 'Black Friday' is indicated and a panicky decline in stocks with only small rallies."</p> <p>Admired for his keen insight and accurate glimpses into the future, Gann nonetheless was&#x2014;and is&#x2014;dismissed by many as being too unconventional, too eccentric and abstruse. However, despite his detractors, his theories remain fundamentally solid, and have been successfully adapted by several generations of traders. Perhaps the most significant of these theories, Gann Theory, is based on the premise that specific geometric patterns and angles have unique characteristics that can be used to predict price action. By combining these patterns with price and time, and by finding a vital balance between these three primary indicators, future market movement can be forecasted.</p> <p>In this authoritative text, expert technician James Hyerczyk presents a straightforward overview of Gann Theory, its basic principles, and its proper applications in creating profitable trading systems. Hyerczyk examines, in complete detail, such essentials as the Master chart, percentage retracements, minor trend indicators, swing chart and angles trading, and cycle dates. In addition, Hyerczyk includes clearly defined, practical guidelines for determining the best combinations of pattern, price, and time to initiate successful trades.</p> <p>The only professional book to explain how to put Gann tools to practical use, Pattern, Price &amp; Time explains how to incorporate these instruments into real-time trading systems for all the major markets, including commodities, financial futures, foreign currencies, and the S&amp;P 500. It also outlines methods for integrating Gann Theory into modern computer charting techniques and systems using current software, such as TradeStation(r), SuperCharts(r), and Excel(r) spreadsheets.</p> <p>Pattern, Price &amp; Time offers a breakthrough look at Gann tools and their use in real-world trading systems, filling a longstanding void in Gann Theory literature. This is a must read for anyone looking to thoroughly understand&#x2014;and successfully implement&#x2014;one of the most important and powerful forecasting methods in existence.</p></p><h2>A Lay Minister&#39;s Guide to the Book of Common Prayer</h2><p>Deepen the lay minister&#39;s knowledge of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer and the various duties of this ministry with this guidebook to lay participation in the Eucharist and Offices of the Church.</p><p></p><h2>Introduction to Semimicro Qualitative Analysis (7th Edition)</h2><p><p>M-&gt;CREATED </p></p><p>A self-teaching lab manual on qualitative analysis.<p> <b> <i>Semimicro Qualitative Analysis,</i> Eighth Edition,</b> addresses two important current issues in chemistry education: the need for students to acquire a knowledge of descriptive chemistry and a growing interest by teaching chemists to expose students to the concepts of "green chemistry." </p> <p> Although descriptive chemistry may be difficult to define precisely, most chemists would agree that a major component of this subject�descriptive chemistry�is the chemistry of the more common elements and their compounds, especially as this occurs in aqueous solutions. </p> <p> "Green chemistry," briefly, is an expression of doing chemistry�laboratory work�that minimizes the use of chemicals, uses benign solvents (like water); and attends to the problems of handling "wastes" in a non-polluting way. </p> <p> The first part of this classic work discusses the general strategy of qualitative analysis.

In this latest book of the acclaimed <i>History of Cartography</i>, contributors from a broad variety of disciplines collaborate to describe and address the significance of traditional cartographies. Whether painted on rock walls in South Africa, chanted in a Melanesian ritual, or fashioned from palm fronds and shells in the Marshall Islands, all indigenous maps share a crucial role in representing and codifying the spatial knowledge of their various cultures. Some also serve as repositories of a group's sacred or historical traditions, while others are exquisite art objects.<br><br>The indigenous maps discussed in this book offer a rich resource for disciplines such as anthropology, archaeology, art history, ethnology, geography, history, psychology, and sociology.

In this first book-length attempt to document traditional cartography outside the Western and Asian civilizations, contributors from a broad variety of disciplines investigate the roles that maps have played in the wayfinding, politics, and religions of these diverse societies.Editors Woodward (geography, Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison) and Lewis (geography, Univ. of Sheffield, England) have produced an unusual survey authored by 11 international scholars. The history of mapmaking is usually approached Eurocentrically, with the possible addition of Arab and Chinese cartographers. However, the expanded definition of "map" employed in the "History of Cartography" seriesA"graphic representations that facilitate a spacial understanding of things, concepts, conditions, processes, or events in the human world"Aallows the inclusion of artifacts made by the traditional or indigenous societies of Africa, the Americas, the Arctic, and Oceania. These unexpected and exceedingly rare sources are as varied as petroglyphs from Southern Africa and Australia; an inscribed moose antler purportedly made by Sacajawea, who accompanied Lewis and Clark; Aztec codices; Incan "quipus"; and Marshallese "mattangs" (stick charts). The map format of Western cultures is sterile when compared with the representational concepts of shamanistic traditional societies. "Cartography becomes less of a gridded stage on which life takes place and more a model of how the spiritual world and physical world interact." The well-documented and authoritative text is enriched by numerous illustrations, including 24 color plates, and an extensive bibliography and index.

After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br> <br> She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br> <br> Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."Gr. 2^-4. From the series that includes <i>Kites Sail High: A Book about Verbs</i> (1988) and <i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns</i> (1989), this volume explores yet another part of speech: prepositions. Although the rhyming text contorts sentence structure from time to time, it provides many examples of prepositions (printed in large, blue type) as well as some rules of usage. Large, colorful drawings illustrate the words imaginatively. While a child alone might find the text confusing, the many teachers who use the series will probably enjoy reading this book aloud to introduce or illustrate prepositions in their classrooms. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Of Wool And Loom: Tradition Of Tibetan Rugs</h2><p>Edited by Kesange G.

Du Maurier had spent a good deal of his life as a child and later as an art student in Paris; when he turned from his career in journalism and magazine illustration to novel writing he found enormous success with a novel divided as his own life had been between Paris and London. Billee, an English artist living the Bohemian life abroad, meets and falls in love with Trilby, a Parisian model. Differences in social class doom their romance, but Trilby, taught by the mysterious hypnotist Svengali to sing like &#x201c;some enchanted princess&#x201d; becomes a famous entertainer. As it turns out, however, her talent and her possession of her own mind have become dependent on Svengali maintaining his spell over her. </p> <p> Originally serialized in Harper&#x2019;s Monthly in 1894, Trilby was published with 120 illustrations by the author (who was also a celebrated caricaturist for Punch). All 120 illustrations were included in the Harper and Brothers New York edition of 1894, and in a British edition published the following year in London. The first British publication in book form, however, (by Osgood &amp; McIlvaine in 1894) did not include any of Du Maurier&#x2019;s illustrations, and many editions since that time have included no illustrations or reproduced only a selection of the illustrations. Particularly given that many of the illustrations are integrated into the page of text in which they appear, Trilby is ideally suited to be made available again in a facsimile reprint. </p> <p> In its first year of publication, the book sold over 200,000 copies, and before long it had also been adapted for the stage. The name &#x201c;Svengali&#x201d; came to be applied to any hypnotist and the image of Svengali carved a lasting place in the popular imagination. Perhaps the most important expression of 1890s Bohemianism, Trilby has also attracted interest in recent years on account of its presentation of hypnosis and split personality, and for the conflicted but often anti-Semitic presentation of the mysterious Svengali. </p> <p> This is one of a series from Broadview Press of facsimile reprint editions&#x2015;editions that provide readers with a direct sense of these works as the Victorians themselves experienced them. </p></p><h2>Navaho Indian Myths (Native American)</h2><p>In the late 1920s, an elderly Navaho leader, anxious to preserve the myths of his people before they were lost in the tide of modern civilization, asked Aileen O'Bryan to record the tales he told her and to publish them in a book. The storyteller was Sandoval, Hastin Tlo'tsi hee (or Old Man Buffalo Grass), the first of the four chiefs of the Navaho People. Ms. O'Bryan, then living in Mesa Verde National Park, wrote down the old man's stories &#x2014; as well as many chants &#x2014; for the most part just as he told them. This book is the result &#x2014; a unique compilation of authentic age-old Navaho origin and creation myth, from which many Navaho tribal ceremonies eventually evolved. Besides their value as mythologic literature, these tales are also intriguing for their revelation of Navaho knowledge of climatic and astronomical phenomena: seasonal changes, the equinox, the moon's effect on the earth and tides and more.<br>Among the myths retold here are: The Creation of the Sun and Moon, The People of the Stone Houses, The Making of the Headdress, The Maiden who Became a Bear, The White Bead Maiden's Marriage with the Sun, The Story of the Rain Ceremony and Its Hogan, The Story of the Two Boys and the Coming of the Horses, The Story of the Navaho and the Apache Peoples, and many others. Over 20 illustrations enhance the text, which will be welcomed by students of Native American culture, anthropologists, folklorists, and anyone intrigued by the myths evolved by the earth's peoples to give meaning to the world and their lives.</p><p></p><h2>Romeo and Juliet In Plain and Simple English: (A Modern Translation and the Original Version)</h2><p>Romeo and Juliet is one of the greatest plays ever written--but let&#39;s face it..if you don&#39;t understand it, then you are not alone.

Its intellectual borders touch those of economics, literature, history, philosophy, and art; its history is the story of the world, both ancient and modern. This is the clear conclusion of <i>Africa and the Disciplines</i>, a book that addresses the question: Why should Africa be studied in the American university?<br> <br> This question was put to distinguished scholars in the social sciences and humanities, prominent Africanists who are also leaders in their various disciplines. Their responses make a strong and enlightening case for the importance of research on Africa to the academy.<br> <br> Paul Collier's essay, for example, shows how studies of African economies have clarified our understanding of the small open economies, and contributed to the theory of repressed inflation and to a number of areas in microeconomics as well. Art historian Suzanne Blier uses the terms and concepts that her discipline has applied to Africa to analyze the habits of mind and social practice of her own field. Christopher L. Miller describes the confounding and enriching impact of Africa on European and American literary theory. Political scientist Richard Sklar outlines Africa's contributions to the study of political modernization, pluralism, and rational choice. These essays, together with others from scholars in history, anthropology, philosophy, and comparative literature, attest to the influence of African research throughout the curriculum.<br> <br> For many, knowledge from Africa seems distant and exotic. These powerful essays suggest the contrary: that such knowledge has shaped the way in which scholars in various disciplines understand their worlds. Eloquent testimony to Africa's necessary place in the mainstream of American education, this book should alter the academy's understanding of the significance of African research, its definition of core and periphery in human knowledge.<br> <br> "These essays are at once exceptionally thoughtful and remarkably comprehensive. Not only do they offer an unusually interesting overview of African studies; they are also striking for the depth and freshness of their insights. This is the sort of volume from which both seasoned regional experts and students stand to learn an enormous amount."&#x2014;John Comaroff, University of Chicago<br> <br> "These essays provide an important perspective on the evolution of African studies and offer insights into what Africa can mean for the different humanistic and social science disciplines. Many show in ingenious and subtle ways the enormous potential that the study of Africa has for confounding the main tenets of established fields. One could only hope that the strictures expressed here would be taken to heart in the scholarly world."&#x2014;Robert L. Tignor, Princeton University</p></p><p>Robert H.

Measuring this distance step by practical step is the philosophical project that Stanley Cavell has pursued on his exploratory path. Situated at the intersection of two of his longstanding interests--Emersonian philosophy and the Hollywood comedy of remarriage--Cavell's new work marks a significant advance in this project. The book--which presents a course of lectures Cavell presented several times toward the end of his teaching career at Harvard--links masterpieces of moral philosophy and classic Hollywood comedies to fashion a new way of looking at our lives and learning to live with ourselves.</p><p>This book offers philosophy in the key of life. Beginning with a rereading of Emerson's "Self-Reliance," Cavell traces the idea of perfectionism through works by Plato, Aristotle, Locke, Kant, Mill, Nietzsche, and Rawls, and by such artists as Henry James, George Bernard Shaw, and Shakespeare. <i>Cities of Words</i> shows that this ever-evolving idea, brought to dramatic life in movies such as <i>It Happened One Night</i>, <i>The Awful Truth</i>, <i>The Philadelphia Story</i>, and <i>The Lady Eve</i>, has the power to reorient the perception of Western philosophy.</p></p><p>Stanley Cavell is Walter M. Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value, Emeritus, at Harvard University.Perhaps more than any living philosopher in the English language Cavell has consistently and almost obsessively been at pains to carve out his own path. He is genuinely original. But more than this his life-long commitment to this project has been undertaken with a philosophical seriousness that is increasingly unusual. City of Words will, then, not only illuminate previous publications on Hollywood film of the 1930s and 1940s, but also enable careful readers to begin to understand how recurrent themes - the import and impact of skepticism and the necessity that we understand its challenge; the strangeness and richness of attending to the everyday; the interfaces between moral, theological and psychoanalytic thought; the common strands in ordinary language philosophy's articulation of key questions in the philosophy of mind and of language and those same questions in the European philosophical school, most especially in the work of Wittgenstein and Heidegger - link together and stretch across readings of the western philosophical tradition. Cities of Words will, then, help the considerable Cavellian oeuvre begin to make sense in a far more substantial, and perhaps unusual way than it has heretofore. It shows us how Cavell ticks. (Peter de Bolla, author of <i>Art Matters</i>)<br><br>What does it mean to live a moral life? In his typically provocative fashion, Cavell answers this question by juxtaposing various philosophical responses with particular films that illuminate those responses...Cavell's 'letters' offer a ready and heady departure from the usual conversation on moral life, and his inventive use of film helps bring the philosophers he discusses to life. (Henry I. Carrigan Jr. <i>Library Journal</i> 2004-05-01)<br><br>A sober examination of an ethics of 'self-reliance,' Cavell's cinematic criticism is as entertaining as it is enlightening and exemplifies, once again, his uncanny ability to recover the deepest insights of modern life within the language of the ordinary. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2004-04-26)<br><br>In <i>Cities of Words</i>, a knotty and enlightening book, chapters about philosophers are paired with chapters about films: Emerson and <i>The Philadelphia Story</i>, Locke and <i>Adam's Rib</i>, Nietzsche and <i>Now, Voyager,</i> Aristotle and <i>The Awful Truth</i>...Cavell shows that the spirit of moral quest has an unusual power, even in the restricted world of these films. For all their artifice, they suggest that characters really can change themselves, that they can form ideals of justice, while keeping in mind how much failure and imperfection will be met along the way. That's not a bad democratic vision, and it remains as potent now as it was when Katharine Hepburn rediscovered her love for Cary Grant. (Edward Rothstein <i>New York Times</i> 2004-05-29)<br><br>In the big parade of American writing about film, Stanley Cavell occupies a strange, outsider position. A Harvard professor of philosophy, he is not, by his own admission, either a film critic or a film scholar; yet he has written with persistent trenchancy and brilliance about movies...Now Cavell, in his late seventies, has given us a volume that synthesizes his life's work in philosophy and film, while adding a third leg to the triangle: teaching. <i>Cities of Words</i> is based on a celebrated course of lectures he gave several times before he retired from the classroom, which alternated discussions of philosophical or literary texts and films...In <i>The World Viewed</i>, Cavell wrote: 'It is generally true of the writing about film which has meant something to me that it has the power of the missing companion. Agee and Robert Warshow and Andr� Bazin manage that mode of conversation all the time; and I have found it in, among others, Manny Farber, Pauline Kael, Parker Tyler, Andrew Sarris.' Alongside these names so companionable to film buffs, I would happily add another: Stanley Cavell. (Phillip Lopate <i>Film Comment</i> 2004-07-01)<br><br>Without genre or parallel, this book continues the interior dialogue of Cavell on the traditions of and prospects for moral perfectionism. (D. W. Sullivan <i>Choice</i> 2004-11-01)<br><br><i>In Cities of Words</i>, Cavell once again reminds us of the practical importance of philosophy. He not only offers insightful commentaries on the giants of moral philosophy but also prompts us to engage in the much-needed conversation about the good life. (Mariana Ortega <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i> 2005-04-08)<br><br>This is a political book, not simply because of Cavell's readings of political philosophy, which intersperse his discussion of the films and are, as usual, probing and original, but because of its overt pedagogical aim: to educate his readers and to show us how we educate each other. (Katerina Deligiorgi <i>Philosophers' Magazine</i> 2005-04-01)</p><h2>Pride &amp; Prejudice</h2><p>Human foibles and early nineteenthcentury manners are satirized in this romantic tale of English family life</p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

This grace seems a remote, almost sentimental concept, without a place in our lives or our society. It is a vague, slippery thing to us, probably because we seem to experience grace so rarely and have managed to leech the word of meaning. But Philip Yancey has set about to rescue grace in his book <i>What's So Amazing About Grace?</i> </p><p> This grace is the true message of Jesus. All faiths have virtues and creeds and justice and truth, but Jesus speaks merely of receiving the love that God has for us. Accepting it, not earning it or making ourselves worthy of it. And frankly, accepting something we have not earned or are not worthy of is not an easy thing for most of us. </p><p> In truth, grace is both utterly simple and utterly confounding. Little by little, Yancey guides us into a clearer understanding of grace by using stories, in much the same way Jesus did. We read stories of both grace and ungrace at work in people's lives. Sadly, it is stories of ungrace that are more prevalent today, the current culture wars painful acknowledgments of ungrace in our lives as Christians in this country. Yancey helps us understand that ungrace is that state of being in which self-righteousness and pride are a result of thinking that we have somehow earned God's approval and may now stand in judgment in his behalf. </p><p> Philip Yancey was awarded the Gold Medallion Christian Book of the Year award for this book in 1998 by the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association. Readers concurred with this decision, making this book an immediate bestseller. Believers and nonbelievers alike should accept Yancey's challenge to become agents of grace rather than agents of vengeance or judgment or anger. In truth, we are each starving for grace, ready to grasp it tightly. And it is through grace that all other hungers--for justice, for righteousness, for love--are satisfied. Yancey opens his book by telling us that "grace" is the last best word, and in <i>What's So Amazing About Grace?</i>, he proves that he's right. <i>--Patricia Klein</i></p>The Jesus I Never Knew and What&#39;s So Amazing About Grace? have influenced the Christian church in a way few other books ever have. Both have ascended to the ranks of ongoing best-sellers. Both have won the Gold Medallion Book of the Year Award--fitting recognition for what may well be Philip Yancey&#39;s two most significant books to date. And now the previously abridged audio editions of these two remarkable works come unabridged.

A rigorous integration of phylogenetic hypotheses into studies of adaptation, adaptive radiation, and coevolution is absolutely necessary and can change dramatically our collective 'gestalt' about much in evolutionary biology. The authors advance and illustrate this thesis beautifully. The writing is often lucid, the examples are plentiful and diverse, and the juxtaposition of examples from different biological systems argues forcefully for the validity of the thesis. Many new insights are offered here, and the work is usually accessible to both the practiced phylogeneticist and the naive ecologist."&#x2014;Joseph Travis, Florida State University<br> <br> "[<i>Phylogeny, Ecology, and Behavior</i>] presents its arguments forcefully and cogently, with ample . . .support. Brooks and McLennan conclude as they began, with the comment that evolution is a result, not a process, and that it is the result of an interaction of a variety of processes, environmental and historical. Evolutionary explanations must consider all these components, else they are incomplete. As Darwin's explanations of descent with modification integrated genealogical and ecological information, so must workers now incorporate historical and nonhistorical, and biological and nonbiological, processes in their evolutionary perspective."&#x2014;Marvalee H. Wake, <i>Bioscience</i><br> <br> "This book is well-written and thought-provoking, and should be read by those of us who do not routinely turn to phylogenetic analysis when investigating adaptation, evolutionary ecology and co-evolution."&#x2014;Mark R.

She offers original interpretations of well-known photographers such as Diane Arbus, Sally Mann, and Carrie Mae Weems, analysing their work in relation to gender, class, and race. The book also pays close attention to the way in which indigenous North Americans have been represented through photography and the ways in which contemporary Native American women photographers respond to this history.</p> <p>Developing the argument that through aesthetic force emerges the truly political, the book moves beyond polarization of the aesthetic and the cultural. Instead, photographic works are read for their subversive political and cultural force, as it emerges through the aesthetics of the image.</p> <p>This book is ideal for students of Photography, Art History, Art and Visual Culture, and Gender.</p></p><p><p><strong>Claire Raymond</strong> teaches Art History at the University of Virginia.

From this readers will understand the universal presence of personality types and the importance of the personality as a determining factor in the unfolding of the psychiatric interview.<br> Students learning psychiatry often ask, "But what do I say to the patient?" In 20 new and updated chapters, <i>The Psychiatric Interview</i> answers that question by using clinical vignettes from the authors' everyday work, what they said in a wide variety of clinical situations and what they felt and thought that led them to say it. Specifically this new edition includes, <ul><li>New chapter sections addressing the process of eliciting a patient's psychodynamic history and the role of information technology in the psychiatric interview. </li><li>New chapters on narcissistic, masochistic, anxious, traumatized, and borderline patients, emphasizing the importance of personality type in determining the evolution of psychiatric disorders and providing copious clinical detail illustrating both what to do and what not to do when interviewing these patients. </li><li>A new chapter presenting a contemporary perspective on "the patient of different background," in which the authors offer valuable guidance on how to approach racial, ethnic, cultural, age, and sexual-orientation differences between interviewer and patient. </li><li>Updated chapters on psychotic patients, patients with schizophrenia, and cognitively impaired patients, and on depressed, obsessive-compulsive, and histrionic patients, incorporating new, emotionally moving vignettes of interviewer-patient interchanges garnered from the authors' extensive clinical experience. </li><li>Updated chapters on hospitalized, psychosomatic, and emergency patients, which are not only psychotherapeutically instructive but also brimming with practical advice for medical students, house staff, doctors, nurses, and social workers.</li></ul> Although <i>The Psychiatric Interview in Clinical Practice</i> is about psychiatric interviewing, many readers will likely recognize aspects of themselves in some of the clinical descriptions. The hope is that this self-recognition will lead to greater self-understanding and self-acceptance as well as to greater understanding and acceptance of others. The clinical examples are about real people, including the authors themselves, their friends, students, and patients. The authors selected situations or traits that are so common and typical that nearly all readers would be able to relate to them.<br> <i>The Psychiatric Interview in Clinical Practice</i> promises to be an enjoyable read as well as a tremendous learning experience for trainees in all of the mental health professions, from medical students and psychiatric residents to psychologists, social workers, and nurses.</p><p><p>In this meticulously revised and expanded edition of <i>The Psychiatric Interview in Clinical Practice</i>, the authors continue to address the challenges inherent in clinical interviewing--the complexities of defense mechanisms, conflicts, wishes, and fantasies--as they did in their original 1971 edition, while also undertaking the daunting task of adapting their interviewing strategies to a new era of psychiatry, one that has witnessed revolutionary breakthroughs in neuroscience, genetics, psychopharmacology, and brain-imaging research.</p><p>In 20 new and updated chapters, the authors comprehensively examine the strategy and conduct of psychodynamically informed clinical interviewing, accommodating the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic nomenclature but also being forthright in critiquing its limitations. Included are new chapters on traumatic, narcissistic, masochistic, anxiety, and borderline conditions and a contemporary perspective on interviewing &#x201c;the patient of different background&#x201d; (i.e., the patient whose race, ethnicity, culture, age, or sexual orientation is different from that of the interviewer). Updated chapters discuss modern psychodynamic theories; interviewing in the context of psychosis, schizophrenia, and cognitive impairment; strategies with hospitalized, psychosomatic, and emergency patients; and approaches with depressed, obsessive-compulsive, and histrionic patients. Incorporated throughout are compelling vignettes of interviewer-patient interchanges garnered from the authors' extensive clinical experience.</p><p> <i>The Psychiatric Interview in Clinical Practice</i> offers a wealth of clinical wisdom useful for trainees in all of the mental health professions, from medical students and psychiatric residents to psychologists, social workers, and nurses.</p><b>Roger A.

The facts of his life, known from surviving documents, are sparse. He was one of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a merchant of some standing in his community. William probably went to the King?s New School in Stratford, but he had no university education. In November 1582, at the age of eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, eight years his senior, who was pregnant with their first child, Susanna. She was born on May 26, 1583. Twins, a boy, Hamnet ( who would die at age eleven), and a girl, Judith, were born in 1585. By 1592 Shakespeare had gone to London working as an actor and already known as a playwright. A rival dramatist, Robert Greene, referred to him as ?an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers.? Shakespeare became a principal shareholder and playwright of the successful acting troupe, the Lord Chamberlain?s Men (later under James I, called the King?s Men). In 1599 the Lord Chamberlain?s Men built and occupied the Globe Theater in Southwark near the Thames River. Here many of Shakespeare?s plays were performed by the most famous actors of his time, including Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, and Robert Armin. In addition to his 37 plays, Shakespeare had a hand in others, including Sir Thomas More and The Two Noble Kinsmen, and he wrote poems, including Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. His 154 sonnets were published, probably without his authorization, in 1609. In 1611 or 1612 he gave up his lodgings in London and devoted more and more time to retirement in Stratford, though he continued writing such plays as The Tempest and Henry VII until about 1613. He died on April 23 1616, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford. No collected edition of his plays was published during his life-time, but in 1623 two members of his acting company, John Heminges and Henry Condell, put together the great collection now called the First Folio.</p><h2>Psychology, 3rd Edition</h2><p><p> <i>The most learner-centered and assessment-driven text available.</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Ciccarelli/White, <i>Psychology, 3/e</i>&nbsp;is praised for a very engaging writing style, comprehensive coverage of key research, and strong pedagogical features.&nbsp;&nbsp;This best-selling&nbsp;text&nbsp;focuses on getting students to actually read their textbook.&nbsp; The authors use the recommended APA undergraduate psychology learning outcomes and establish clear learning objectives for students, while tying the text assessment to these objectives.&nbsp; Student and instructor feedback from extremely successful first and second editions emphasize the appeal of Ciccarelli/White's approach to teaching and learning in today's classroom.&nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Saundra K.

It moves from the pastoral World War I&#x2013;era Bohemia of Josef&#x2019;s youth, to a German boarding school full of creeping prejudice, through an infamous extermination camp, and finally to Josef&#x2019;s self-imposed exile abroad, achieving veracity and power through a stream-of-consciousness style reminiscent of our greatest modern masters.

We&#x2019;re going to the panorama.&#x201d; Josef hears the voice of his grandmother and looks up from his toy. Panorama. Various pictures from all over the world. &#x201c;Really, are we going?&#x201d; The toy is abandoned, the dominoes, the building set, the train. It&#x2019;s a long way, yet Josef and his grandmother love the panorama. They sit in the streetcar, the motor rattles and sings. Josef often plays streetcar. He runs along the long curbstones of the sidewalk, which is the track. Josef hums with his mouth closed and imitates the streetcar. First he calls out, &#x201c;Ding! Dong Dong!,&#x201d; then comes the humming and sighing of the motor. Streetcar conductor is the best job of all, for you get to sell tickets, punch the tickets, and call out the stops.<br><br>&#x201c;We have to get off, Josef, come!&#x201d; They draw past the embankment and see many people all dressed up. &#x201c;Give me your hand! It&#x2019;s so crowded here.&#x201d; Already they have turned in to the quiet little lane where the panorama is located. Now they stand before the door. It&#x2019;s a simple storefront with a small display window, and there Josef peers at the beautiful pictures, whether it be Vesuvius, Niagara Falls, the Great Pyramid, or other wonders of the world. There&#x2019;s also an announcement for that day&#x2019;s program. Josef sounds it out: &#x201c;Li-ma, the Cap-i-tal of Pe-ru.&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;Come, come, there&#x2019;s more to see inside.&#x201d; They next enter a little lobby that is separated from the actual panorama by a heavy curtain. Behind a table on which stands a sign that says tickets sits a powdered woman. Grandmother gives her a silver coin and takes from the powdery lady two little red tickets, as well as a nickel and some copper change. Josef is allowed to pocket the nickel. &#x201c;Save it! Don&#x2019;t spend it on sweets!&#x201d;<br><br>The grandmother weaves her way with Josef through the curtain and enters an almost completely darkened room. Around a polyhedral wooden cabinet high stools are arranged. In front of each one there are two round openings, which are dark peepholes located beneath a metal shield. You hold your eyes up or press them to the shield and the program appears. An attendant receives the guests and takes them to two free spots. The grandmother sits down, but the attendant lifts Josef up and presses him close to the peepholes. The two peepholes are there so that you see everything just the way it really looks, and everything is enlarged so that it seems completely alive. Everything appears lit by brilliant golden light, as if dipped in tropical sunlight. Each picture stands there for a minute, maybe less. To Josef it feels like a good long time. He&#x2019;s pleased that it lasts so long, for he can&#x2019;t get enough of the splendid sights. But it&#x2019;s a shame that the people, animals, and wagons in the pictures don&#x2019;t move. Though the fact they don&#x2019;t move doesn&#x2019;t make the life depicted in the beautiful pictures any less marvelous, it does make them seem like something outside of time. Before the pictures change, the delicate strike of a little bell warns: &#x201c;Attention, time&#x2019;s up! Get ready for the next wonder!&#x201d; Then the picture moves away, another draws near, the next stands before Josef at last. If he doesn&#x2019;t turn his gaze away from the peepholes and presses his face hard against the shield, he feels completely alone with the pictures. The daily world disappears and is gone. The viewer and the picture become one on the inside, no one can get in. Josef himself, however, cannot wander off into the pictures, for he remains sitting on his stool, his upper body bent forward slightly. Because of this he cannot sit comfortably, nor is there any chair back, so there&#x2019;s no resting at all. In the panorama, however, that doesn&#x2019;t matter. Josef is content. One can be comfortable anywhere else, it&#x2019;s only in the panorama that this isn&#x2019;t possible. Everything here is hard and fixed and tense. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s not necessary for the grandmother to say, &#x201c;Pay attention, in order that you get something out of this and learn from it!&#x201d; Only when the pictures change does the tension ease for just a moment. Josef scoots forward on his stool in order to see better still. Beneath the peepholes a piece of tin is attached against which he breathes. The tin gathers moisture and sometimes Josef likes to run his fingers over its smooth flatness so that his fingertips feel damp. The grandmother pays no attention to Josef, for she knows how the panorama captivates him, so much so that he is better behaved than usual. That&#x2019;s why the little naughtiness with wiping his fingers remains ignored. Normally there is no opportunity here to misbehave. The otherwise familiar world has disappeared. Here is another world, which one can only gaze at, there being no other way to enter but to gaze. Only these little holes are there for the eyes. Josef can see so for himself, simply by touching the glass, that there is no other way in. All the people and the distant lands that you encounter in these pictures remain untouchable behind the glass walls that are only large enough for the eyes.<br><br>It&#x2019;s fairly quiet in the panorama. Except for the little bell that announces the change in pictures, you only hear the guests coming and going, or a stool scraping, now and then a couple of words someone might whisper to his neighbor. You hardly ever hear the attendant. Thus the world you normally live in is turned off, and has in fact passed away. Another world is risen, which neither reading nor studying nor even dreams can manifest. Nonetheless, Josef can step only a little way into the other world, though he cannot take part in it. If he shoves his knee forward he immediately bumps up against the wooden cabinet. Soon it&#x2019;s clear how little is allowed. Everywhere there are barriers, nowhere can you immerse yourself entirely. Josef sees the other world, but it doesn&#x2019;t care about him. It consists only of parts that are put together. The only way for it to be different would be for the pictures to move, to continue on and flow into one another, yet each is presented on its own and is clearly separated from the next. The other world is a program that is immensely beautiful, but nothing more. Next week the program changes, and so on week after week. There is no whole, only individual pieces without end. Even today&#x2019;s program has no proper end but just repeats itself over and over. There are perhaps sixty, maybe eighty pictures, though there certainly are not a hundred. Eventually a picture comes along that has been there already. Josef doubts this at first, but after the next chiming of the little bell another picture appears that is also familiar. The grandmother still looks on. She starts to get restless on her chair. After the little bell strikes again and a third picture arrives that most certainly has been there already, the grandmother turns to Josef. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s over, my dear. We&#x2019;ve seen that one already. We have to go.&#x201d;<br><br>The grandmother stands. The attendant is already there and lifts Josef down; the grandmother helps and takes the boy by the hand. Then the attendant pulls back the curtain. In the lobby the daylight is so strong that the grandmother warns, &#x201c;Child, close your eyes!&#x201d; She doesn&#x2019;t have to say anything, for Josef squints and allows himself to be led out almost blind. The grandmother doesn&#x2019;t let on how much it all pleased her, but says, &#x201c;Be careful, and watch where you&#x2019;re going.&#x201d; Josef doesn&#x2019;t know whether the warning is about the spectacle in the panorama or the way that leads home.</p><h2>Stepping Up - Leader Kit: A Journey Through the Psalms of Ascent</h2><p><p><b>Stepping Up: A Journey Through the Psalms of Ascent - Leader Kit</b> by <b>Beth Moore,</b> helps a leader facilitate this women's Bible study of Psalms 120-134 and contains all that is needed to conduct the 6 weeks of small group time.

And what an eventful and tumultuous six decades it had been. During that time, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), China was transformed from one of the world's poorest countries into the world's fastest growing major economy, and from a weak state barely able to govern or protect its own territory to a rising power that is challenging the United States for global influence. <br><br>Over those same years, the PRC also experienced the most deadly famine in human history, caused largely by the actions and inactions of its political leaders. Not long after, there was a collapse of government authority that pushed the country to the brink of (and in some places actually into) civil war and anarchy. <br><br>Today, China is, for the most part, peaceful, prospering, and proud. This is the China that was on display for the world to see during the Beijing Olympics in 2008. The CCP maintains a firm grip on power through a combination of popular support largely based on its recent record of promoting rapid economic growth and harsh repression of political opposition. Yet, the party and country face serious challenges on many fronts, including a slowing economy, environmental desecration, pervasive corruption, extreme inequalities, and a rising tide of social protest.<br><br><em>Politics in China</em> is an authoritative introduction to how the world's most populous nation and rapidly rising global power is governed today. Written by leading China scholars, the book's chapters offers accessible overviews of major periods in China's modern political history from the mid-nineteenth century to the present, key topics in contemporary Chinese politics, and developments in four important areas located on China's geographic periphery: Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.<br></p><p><br><strong>William A.

It discusses Einstein and Goedel's views on the nature of mathematics in the light of information theory, and sustains the thesis that mathematics is quasi-empirical. There is a foreword by Cris Calude of the University of Auckland, and supplementary material is available at the author's web site. The special feature of this book is that it presents a new "hands on" didatic approach using LISP and Mathematica software. The reader will be able to derive an understanding of the close relationship between mathematics and physics.

At its essence, marketing strategy planning is about figuring out how to do a superior job of satisfying customers. This author team takes that point of view seriously and believes in practicing what they preach. Instructors and students can trust that this new edition of <i>Essentials of Marketing</i> 13e&#x2013; and all of the other teaching and learning materials that accompany it &#x2013; will satisfy every instructor and students&#x2019; needs.<br><br> <b>Building on Pioneering Strengths</b><br><br> This author team pioneered an innovative structure&#x2015; using the &#x201c;four Ps&#x201d; with a managerial approach&#x2015;for the introductory marketing course. It quickly became one of the most widely used business textbooks ever published because it organized the best ideas about marketing so that readers could both understand and apply them. The unifying focus of these ideas is on how to make the marketing decisions that a manager must make in deciding what customers to target and how best to meet their needs. <br><br> Over many editions of <i>Basic Marketing</i> and <i>Essentials of Marketing</i>, there have been constant changes in marketing management and the marketing environment. Some of the changes have been dramatic, and others have been subtle. As a result, the authors have made ongoing changes to the text to reflect marketing&#x2019;s best practices and ideas. <br><br> <b>What's different about <i>Essentials of Marketing</i>?</b><br><br> The success of this franchise is not the result of a single strength&#x2015;or one long-lasting innovation. Other text books have adopted the four Ps framework and the Perreault author team has continuously improved the book. The text&#x2019;s four Ps framework, managerial orientation, and strategy planning focus have proven to be foundational pillars that are remarkably robust for supporting new developments in the field and innovations in the text and package. <br><br> <ol><li><i>Essentials of Marketing</i> teaches students <b>analytical abilities and how-to-do-it skills</b> that prepare them for success. The author team has deliberately included a variety of examples, explanations, frameworks, models, classification systems, cases, and &#x201c;how-to-do-it&#x201d; techniques that relate to our overall framework for marketing strategy planning. Similarly, the <i>Marketing Plan Coach</i> on the text website helps students see how to create marketing plans. Taken together, these items speed the development of &#x201c;marketing sense&#x201d; and enable the student to analyze marketing situations and develop marketing plans in a confident and meaningful way. They are practical and they work. </li> <li>As opposed to many other marketing text books, the authors emphasize careful <b>integration of special topics.</b> Some textbooks treat &#x201c;special&#x201d; topics&#x2015;like relationship marketing, international marketing, services marketing, marketing and the Internet, marketing for nonprofit organizations, marketing ethics, social issues, and business-to-business marketing&#x2015;in separate chapters. The authors deliberatively avoid doing that because they are convinced that treating such topics separately leads to an unfortunate compartmentalization of ideas. </li> <li>The comprehensive package of materials gives instructors the <b>flexibility</b> to <b><i>teach marketing their way</i></b>- or for the student, the ability to <b><i>learn marketing their way.</i></b></li></ol></p><p>Teaches at the Universities of Oregon, Notre Dame, and Michigan State.</p><h2>The Deliberative Practitioner: Encouraging Participatory Planning Processes</h2><p><p>Citizen participation in such complex issues as the quality of the environment, neighborhood housing, urban design, and economic development often brings with it suspicion of government, anger between stakeholders, and power plays by many&#x2015;as well as appeals to rational argument. Deliberative planning practice in these contexts takes political vision and pragmatic skill. Working from the accounts of practitioners in urban and rural settings, North and South, John Forester shows how skillful deliberative practices can facilitate practical and timely participatory planning processes. In so doing, he provides a window onto the wider world of democratic governance, participation, and practical decision-making. Integrating interpretation and theoretical insight with diverse accounts of practice, Forester draws on political science, law, philosophy, literature, and planning to explore the challenges and possibilities of deliberative practice.</p></p><p>John Forester is Associate Professor of City and Regional Planning at Cornell University.<p>This book represents the culmination of a decade's work and succeeds. Forester, perhaps the finest planning theorist in the U.S., uses a variety of case studies to show how his ideas about deliberation shape planning practice. He speaks to the problems and worries of practitioners and students of planning in all types of public settings. This book will likely prove popular as a text in planning schools and appeal to professionals in a variety of allied disciplines.</p>&#x2015;<b>Charles J.

He efficiently presents the complex C++ language in this well-designed tutorial/reference that both students and seasoned programmers will appreciate. The book is ideal as a primary text for intermediate C++ courses, as a supplemental no-nonsense reference for other courses, or for independent learning by professionals. </p> <p> <b>C++ for Java Programmers</b> is a concise, well-written text that provides authoritative and up-to-date coverage of key features and details of C++, with a special focus on how C++ compares to Java. The book's approach shows knowledgeable students or professionals how to grasp the complexities of C++ and harness its power by mutually addressing the benefits and the pitfalls of the two languages. By highlighting the features and comparative elements of each language, and building on the reader's existing knowledge of object-oriented programming, <b>C++ for Java Programmers</b> enables users to master the essentials of C++ quickly and thoroughly. </p> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li>Includes insightful comparisons of the two programming languages throughout the text and points out the subtleties of C++</li> <li>Succinctly covers the pertinent highlights of STL (Standard Template Library) and the most effective use of templates</li> <li>Explains the use of the powerful JNI (Java Native Interface) for combining Java and C++</li> <li>Includes a summary of key C++ features and issues with each chapter</li> <li>Provides extensive treatment of C details the programmer is likely to encounter in C++</li> <li>Companion Website for complete online source code at:<br> <b>http://www.prenhall.com/weiss</b> </li> <li>Available Instructors Resource CD-ROM</li> </ul><p> For many years, C++ was the <i>defacto</i> language of choice in introductory Computer Science courses, due largely to its support for object-oriented programming, as well as its wide adoption in industry. However, because C++ is arguably the most complex language ever to be widely-used, Java, which also supports object-oriented programming, recently has emerged as the preferred introductory language. Nonetheless, demand for C++ skill is still high in industry and most universities require C++ programming at some point in the Computer Science curriculum. Although Java and C++ look similar, programming in C++ is somewhat more challenging and filled with subtle details. While there are many books that thoroughly describe C++ (see the Bibliography), the vast majority exceed 1,000 pages and, for the most part, are written for either experienced industry programmers or novices. </p> <p> This book is designed as a quick start guide for students who are knowledgeable in an object-oriented language (most likely Java) and would like to learn C++. Throughout the text, we compare and contrast Java and C++, and show C++ substitutes for Java equivalents. We do not describe in detail basic concepts (such as inheritance) that are common in both C++ and Java; rather, we describe how the concepts are implemented in C++. This helps achieve one of the important goals of this book, which is to keep the page count reasonably low. Consequently, this book is not appropriate for students who have limited or no prior programming experience. </p> <p><b>Organization</b></p> The book begins with a brief overview of C++ in Chapter 0. In Chapter 1, we describe some of the basic expressions and statements in C++, which mostly mirror simple Java syntax. Functions, arrays, strings, and parameter passing are discussed in Chapter 2. We use the modern alternative of introducing and using the standard vector and string classes in the C++ library, rather than the older-style built-in array constructs. <p></p> <p> Chapter 3 describes pointers and reference variables, paying particular attention to the host of pitfalls that await a C++ programmer. Chapter 4 is a long chapter that describes the basics of classes. </p> <p> Two C++ features that are not part of Java are operator overloading and templates. Operator overloading is discussed in Chapter 5 and templates are discussed in Chapter 7. In between, we cover inheritance in Chapter 6. In Chapter 8, we examine exceptions in C++, as well as older library routines such as abort. </p> <p> The next two chapters discuss some C++ libraries. Chapter 9 deals with I/O and Chapter 10 introduces the Standard Template Library, which is the C++ equivalent of the Collections API. Both libraries are complex enough to require an entire book: We provide the most important highlights, rather than attempting to list every detail. </p> <p> Many courses will require C programming in addition to C++ programming. Because C++ builds on C, many C programming techniques are also found in C++, although in C++ they are not always the preferred way to do things. Chapter 11 covers primitive arrays and strings. As we mentioned earlier, modern C++ uses library classes as an alternative. Nonetheless, primitive arrays and strings will almost certainly be encountered by any C++ programmer, and the techniques are essentially the same in C++ and C. Chapter 12 covers C idioms that are occasionally used in C++, but probably should be avoided. Finally, in Chapter 13, we describe the Java Native Interface (again a whole book can be written on this one topic), which allows Java programmers to implement their methods in C++ or C. </p></p><h2>Scandinavian Language Structures: A Comparative Historical Survey</h2><p>From rear cover notes: &#34;The Scandinavian languages constitute the northern branch of the Germanic family of languages; the earliest written evidences of any Germanic language are found in the runic inscriptions of Scandinavia, dating back to 200 A.D.

The book begins with a brief historical survey of European folk art. The first chapter is devoted to supplies: working with acrylic paints, selecting brushes, and gathering other essential materials. After reviewing several basic painting techniques and how to correctly prepare surfaces, the author presents detailed demonstrations of the decorative painting styles of England, Norway, Holland, Germany, and Russia. The projects feature motifs traditionally painted on wood, metal, and porcelain, and incorporate a range of techniques, including decorative strokework, working wet-in-wet, and antiquing.</p><p>Andy B. Jones, the author of Painting American Folk Art, Painting Animals, Decorative Paint Finishes for the Home, and Decorative Painter&#39;s Guide to Fruits and Flowers, is a partner in an Atlanta-based design firm specializing in painted finishes for interiors.Jones has taken the idea of decorative painting beyond the usual craft book into an exploration of rich European traditions. Three chapters provide excellent training in craft painting basics. The rest of this book is devoted to projects in English folk art (e.g., roses on a canal boat water can), the German Bauernmalerei style, Dutch painted woodcarving motifs, and projects based on Russian and Norwegian folk art. Jones takes historical pieces as examples and creates modern interpretations, using only acrylics.

He has one of the smartest business minds I know. When he gives me advice, I pay attention, and you should, too. Automatic Wealth is full of wisdom and insight filtered by a master and brought to you in a well-written and delightful style."<br> -John Mauldin, Editor of the bestselling book, Just One Thing: Twelve of the World's Best Investors Reveal the One Strategy You Can't Overlook<br> <br> "I am not usually a fan of this kind of book. One entitled Automatic Wealth made me suspicious. But I am a fan of Michael Masterson, and when I read the book, I was impressed. Masterson manages to go beyond the theory to tell you exactly how real people make real money in the real world. That, I think, is his genius. He's able to open his own eyes and see for himself what actually works. The result is original, clever, and very helpful to anyone who is serious about building wealth."<br> -Bill Bonner, coauthor of Empire of Debt: The Rise of an Epic Financial Crisis<br> <br> "Michael Masterson has been a great friend of mine for over twenty years. I know for a fact that the strategy he teaches is the exact same strategy he has personally used to amass extraordinary wealth and prosperity for himself. He's reduced a normally daunting process down to six simple and unfailing steps YOU can absolutely use to vastly and rapidly increase your financial situation, often times doubling and redoubling your wealth every few years. This book will become your financial bible."<br> -Jay Abraham, author of Getting Everything You Can Out of All You've Got: 21 Ways You Can Out-Think, Out-Perform, and Out-Earn the Competition<br> <br> "Michael Masterson's book is brilliant and concise, packed with breakthrough insights and unique wealth-building tips. Best of all, it's practical because it combines proven investment and financial planning advice with street-smart business and real estate secrets."<br> -Robert Ringer, author of Action!, Looking Out for #1, and To Be or Not to Be Intimidated?</p><p>The advice and concepts outlined in <i>Automatic Wealth</i> are best suited for those in their 30s-50s who recognize that their current job will never afford them true financial independence. Rather than encourage readers to quit their day jobs today and launch into a new scheme tomorrow, Masterson shows how to turn your skills and experience into significantly more money within seven to fifteen years. For those just getting by, he details how to get the biggest pay raises now and how to move into more lucrative ventures in the near future. For those with some savings, he offers specific advice on building equity and increasing net worth significantly and quickly. Since Masterson made his millions starting and developing small businesses, he encourages people to become entrepreneurs themselves and discusses which kinds of ventures to invest in and which ones to avoid. He also stresses the importance of developing multiple income streams, offering chapters on real estate, stocks and bonds, consulting, direct mail, and other opportunities.<p> In addition to concrete steps, Masterson also writes about attitude and expectations. His first step, in fact, is to take an honest and realistic assessment of your current financial situation and prepare yourself to change habits. He stresses that you must make getting rich a priority and devote the necessary time to it--act immediately and don't wait until the perfect moment to change your situation (hint: the perfect moment rarely arrives.). Clearly written and filled with informative anecdotes and examples, <i>Automatic Wealth</i> will not make you a millionaire overnight. It could, however, make you one in a decade, and that's a timeline most people can deal with. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>If you're worried about getting burned by financial programs that promise you'll get rich quick&#x2014;through unlikely stock tips or high-risk trading strategies&#x2014;and don't have the patience to invest in a savings plan that takes thirty or forty years to take advantage of the "miracle of compound interest," then you've picked up the right book. <p>In Automatic Wealth, self-made millionaire Michael Masterson draws upon his own experience and that of experts in the fields of retirement, investing, and real estate to offer you a complete program on achieving financial independence. Organized around six key principles, Automatic Wealth will show you how to develop your wealth- building skills and habits and turn yourself into an "automatic wealth-builder."</p> <p>The proven program detailed throughout this book&#x2014;one which incorporates nothing but strategies that have personally worked for Masterson as well as the people he's mentored&#x2014;is broken down into six easy steps:</p> <ul> <li>Facing the Facts&#x2014;Here you'll discover what wealth means to you and come to a realistic conclusion about what you need to do to put yourself on a path that will allow you to live well and retire comfortably.</li> <li>Plan to Become Wealthy&#x2014;Offers simple, straightforward advice that will prepare you for your journey.</li> <li>Develop Wealthy Habits&#x2014;Illustrates how the right mind-set can translate into more money.</li> <li>Radically Increase Your Income&#x2014;Provides the framework for making the money you want through real estate, investing, and other proven financial vehicles.</li> <li>Get Richer While You Sleep&#x2014;Reveals the best ways to create a steady stream of income that will automatically flow into your pocket.</li> <li>Retire Early&#x2014;Explores proven approaches to wealth building that will allow you to retire sooner than you might have expected and still live comfortably throughout your retirement years.</li> </ul> <p>Automatic Wealth follows a well-conceived plan that focuses on building income and equity simultaneously. Filled with in-depth insight and practical advice, this unique guide offers specific steps&#x2014;including how to develop wealth-building habits now and how to develop a three- to fifteen-year plan to reach millionaire status&#x2014;that will help you live a more fulfilling financial life.</p></p><h2>Law and Society</h2><p><strong>Law and Society</strong> offers a contemporary yet concise description of the structure and function of legal institutions, along with a lively discussion of both criminal and civil law, as well as basic legal doctrine. Unlike comparable books on law and society available today, Matthew Lippman takes an interdisciplinary approach to integrate distinctive coverage of diversity, inequality, and globalism through an organized theme in a strong narrative. This practical and invigorating text provides readers with a better understanding of the connection between law and society and the impact recent literature on crime, justice, international human rights, and law has had to promote that connection.</p><p><p><strong>Matthew Lippman</strong> is Professor Emeritus at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and has taught criminal law and criminal procedure in the Department of Criminology, Law, and Justice for more than thirty years.

Included is treatment of corporate and unincorporated business forms, major tax aspects, securities regulation, antitrust aspects, Uniform Commercial Code and other relevant uniform acts, national securities exchange requirements, and bankruptcy and corporate reorganizations. Since its coverage encompasses and expands upon the curricular descriptions of most law school corporations courses, it should provide insights into many related areas. <p>This third edition follows the traditional trilevel Hornbook approach: (1) The overview in the bold face summaries at the beginning of each of the 389 sections; (2) The adequate coverage of the laws in the 1171 pages of text; and (3) The guides to further information and research in the 5,769 footnotes. The table of more than 5,250 cases continues to be keyed to commentaries in legal periodicals. </p><p>This third edition is designed to provide a comprehensive one-volume treatment of corporation laws, with special emphasis on developments during the past decade. It updates information on unincorporated business enterprises, especially under the 1976 Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, expands coverage of California law equaling it with coverage of the various current and earlier versions of the Model Business Corporation Act, Delaware, and New York; and treats the current propositions for corporate governance, burden of proof, right to jury trial, collateral estoppel, "independent" litigation committee and oversight committees of the board of directors, "D &amp; O liability insurance", and federal securities, tax, and bankruptcy and reorganization provisions.</p></p><p></p><h2>Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction</h2><p>Bondspeople who fled from slavery during and after the Civil War did not expect that their flight toward freedom would lead to sickness, disease, suffering, and death. But the war produced the largest biological crisis of the nineteenth century, and as historian Jim Downs reveals in this groundbreaking volume, it had deadly consequences for hundreds of thousands of freed people.<br><br>In <em>Sick from Freedom</em>, Downs recovers the untold story of one of the bitterest ironies in American history--that the emancipation of the slaves, seen as one of the great turning points in U.S. history, had devastating consequences for innumerable freed people. Drawing on massive new research into the records of the Medical Division of the Freedmen's Bureau-a nascent national health system that cared for more than one million freed slaves-he shows how the collapse of the plantation economy released a plague of lethal diseases. With emancipation, African Americans seized the chance to move, migrating as never before. But in their journey to freedom, they also encountered yellow fever, smallpox, cholera, dysentery, malnutrition, and exposure. To address this crisis, the Medical Division hired more than 120 physicians, establishing some forty underfinanced and understaffed hospitals scattered throughout the South, largely in response to medical emergencies. Downs shows that the goal of the Medical Division was to promote a healthy workforce, an aim which often excluded a wide range of freedpeople, including women, the elderly, the physically disabled, and children. Downs concludes by tracing how the Reconstruction policy was then implemented in the American West, where it was disastrously applied to Native Americans. <br><br>The widespread medical calamity sparked by emancipation is an overlooked episode of the Civil War and its aftermath, poignantly revealed in <em>Sick from Freedom</em>.<em> </em><br></p><p><br><strong>Jim Downs </strong>is Associate Professor of History and American Studies at Connecticut College. He is the editor of <em>Taking Back the Academy: History of Activism, History as Activism</em> and <em>Why We Write: The Politics and Practice of Writing for Social Change</em>.<br><br>"An important challenge to our understanding of an event that scholars and laypeople alike have preferred to see as an uplifting story of newly liberated people vigorously claiming their long-denied rights." - <em>The New York Times<br><br></em>"Downs has written a scholarly book about emancipation that should open a whole new discussion about how it was achieved. If there is any doubt about his assertions, he has included 56 pages of footnotes." --&nbsp;<em>The Washington Post</em><br><br>"Jim Downs' exceptional research has resulted in a major study ... Highly recommended." --<em>Civil War News</em><br><em></em><br><br><em></em> <p></p> <em></em>"As Jim Downs makes clear in this carefully documented work, the Union leadership, domestic and military, was wholly unprepared to deal with the breakdown of the system of slavery that followed the Union army with every foray into southern soil. ... However one may 'spin' the story, one comes away from this book with no doubt that the path out of slavery was a minefield of death and disease that needs its proper acknowledgment in histories of reconstruction." -- <em>Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences</em> <p></p> <br>"James Downs' <em>Sick from Freedom</em> is a signal contribution to the vastly understudied question of freedpeople's health and a formidable challenge to the dominant analytical framework that has heretofore framed our understanding both of the transition from slavery to freedom in the American South and the meaning of death and dying in the era of the Civil War. It, quite simply, remaps a field. Against an archival record of statistics--of so many bodies sick or dying and denied access to local and state hospitals and asylums--Downs gives us the story of a people, of individual men, women and children 'dying to be free.'" -- Thavolia Glymph, Duke University <br><br>"A fresh and ambitious account of the Civil War era that not only interrogates the transition from slavery to freedom in new and unsettling ways but also invites us to rethink the geographical dimensions of Reconstruction." --Steven Hahn, University of Pennsylvania <br><br>"Jim Downs's <em>Sick from Freedom</em> charts new, darker, and profoundly revealing paths into the history of the American emancipation in the Civil War. In a work of medical, social, labor, and military history all at once, Downs shows that achieving freedom for American slaves was a signal triumph, but only through a horrible passage of disease, suffering and death. A 'new' history of emancipation is emerging, and Downs is one of its most talented and innovative craftsmen. This book demonstrates that emancipation is real history and not mere sentimental celebration." --David W. Blight, author of <em>American Oracle: The Civil War in the Civil Rights Era</em> <br><br>"In <em>Sick from Freedom</em>, Jim Downs paints a startling and little known portrait of African American emancipation in which struggles for health and survival must be factored alongside the political and economic history of the period." --Sharla Fett, Occidental College <br> <br> <p></p> <br>"<em>Sick from Freedom</em> by Jim Downs traces a shrouded chapter of American history: the mass death and medical devastation that visited African Americans in the immediate wake of legal emancipation. Downs compellingly reveals how the confluence of racial slander, government indifference, and medical malign neglect proved widely fatal, and in doing so he paints a detailed and disheartening portrait of man's inhumanity to man." --Harriet Washington, author of <em>Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present</em> <p></p> <br></p><h2>Aldous Huxley&#39;s Hands: His Quest for Perception and the Origin and Return of Psychedelic Science</h2><p>Psychedelics, neuroscience, and historical biography come together when a journalist finds a lost photograph of Aldous Huxley and uncovers a hidden side of the celebrated author of Brave New World and The Doors of Perception. Allene Symons had no inkling that Aldous Huxley was once a friend of her father&#39;s until the summer of 2001 when she discovered a box of her dad&#39;s old photographs. For years in the 1940s and &#39;50s, her father had meticulously photographed human hands in the hope of developing a science of predicting human aptitudes and even mental illness. In the box, along with all the other hand images, was one with the name of Aldous Huxley on the back. How was it possible for two such unlikely people to cross paths--her aircraft-engineer father and the famous author?This question sparked a journalist&#39;s quest to understand what clearly seemed to be a little-known interest of Aldous Huxley. Through interviews, road trips, and family documents, the author reconstructs a time peaking in mid-1950s Los Angeles when Huxley experimented with psychedelic substances, ran afoul of gatekeepers, and advocated responsible use of such hallucinogens to treat mental illness as well as to achieve states of mind called mystical. Because the author&#39;s father had studied hundreds of hands, including those of schizophrenics, he was invited into Huxley&#39;s research and discussion circle.This intriguing narrative about the early psychedelic era throws new light on one of the 20th-century&#39;s foremost intellectuals, showing that his experiments in consciousness presaged pivotal scientific research underway today.</p><p><b>Allene Symons</b> is the author of <i>Nostradamus, Vagabond Prophet: A Novel of His Life and Time</i> and an instructor of communications and media studies at Santa Ana College. She previously worked as a senior editor at <i>Publishers Weekly, Drug Store News</i>, and <i>For the Pharmacist</i> magazines and as general manager of Rizzoli International Bookstore in Costa Mesa, California.&#x201c;Allene Symons has written an intriguing combination of an Aldous Huxley biography, a smart daughter&#x2019;s memoir of her father, and science&#x2014;ranging from schizophrenia to paranormal consciousness to psychedelics. Several years ago, while going through boxes in her family&#x2019;s garage, she found over one thousand photographs of hands, including Aldous Huxley&#x2019;s, that her father had taken over a two-decade period. What was her aircraft-engineer father trying to discover and how did he cross paths with Huxley? The answers are fascinating and sometimes mind-bending. . . . It&#x2019;s an absorbing and beguiling read.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2014;LISA SEE, author of <i>China Dolls</i>, <i>Snow Flower and the Secret Fan</i>, and <i>On Gold Mountain</i><br>&#x201c;What can be said about the work of Aldous Huxley that hasn&#x2019;t already been told? Quite a bit, it turns out. In this compelling narrative, Allene Symons uncovers a cache of letters between Huxley and the man who turned him on to psychedelic drugs, using those documents to spin a delightful tale of two men exploring the thin line between mysticism and madness. Symons deftly blends the legwork of a journalist with the passion of a daughter fascinated by her own father&#x2019;s unlikely foray into Huxley&#x2019;s inner circle.&#x201d;<br><br><i> &#x2014;</i>DON LATTIN, author of<i> The Harvard Psychedelic Club </i>and <i>Distilled Spirits&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><br>&#x201c;The psychedelic Sixties didn&#x2019;t begin in the 1960s. That much is certain after reading <i>Aldous Huxley&#x2019;s Hands</i>. Allene Symons, an engaging writer and reporter, discovered in 2001 that in the 1950s her father, a photographer, was friends with the writer, philosopher, poet, and satirist whose experiments with hallucinogens opened <i>The Doors of Perception</i>. Symons&#x2019;s own explorations led to new revelations and insights about Huxley, as well as about her father. Both were ahead of their time, and their work resonates with the world today&#x2014;and, of course, tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;BEN FONG-TORRES, former senior editor, <i>Rolling Stone; </i>columnist,<i> San Francisco Chronicle; </i>and an Emmy Award&#x2013;winning broadcaster</p><h2>The Resolution of Conflict: Constructive and Destructive Processes (Carl Hovland Memorial Lectures Series)</h2><p>Conflict is a natural and inevitable part of our personal and social lives.

The 1980-1981 program of the William Alanson White Psychoanaly� tic Society was devoted to supervision-with representatives of various &#34;schools&#34; demonstrating their ways of doing consultations with ana� lysts about patients.

As well as having strong ties to scientism -the notion that only the methods of the natural sciences give rise to knowledge -it also has humanistic ties to the great thinkers and philosophical problems of the past. Moreover, no single feature characterizes the activities of analytic philosophers. Undaunted by these difficulties, Avrum Stroll investigates the &#34;family resemblances&#34; between that impressive breed of thinkers known as analytic philosophers. In so doing, he grapples with the point and purpose of doing philosophy: What is philosophy? What are its tasks? What kind of information, illumination, and understanding is it supposed to provide if it is not one of the natural sciences? Imbued with clarity, liveliness, and philosophical sophistication, Stroll�s book presents a synoptic picture of the main developments in logic, philosophy of language, epistemology, and metaphysics in the past century. It does this by concentrating on the individual thinkers whose ideas have been most influential. Major themes in Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy include: � the innovation of mathematical logic by Gottlob Frege at the close of the nineteenth century and its independent development by Bertrand Russell; � the impact of advancements in science on the world of philosophy and its importance for understanding such doctrines as logical positivism, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and eliminative materialism; � the refusal by such thinkers as Wittgenstein, Moore, and Austin to treat logic as an ideal language superior to natural languages; and � a conjecture about which, if any, of the philosophers discussed in the book will enter the pantheon of philosophical gods. Along the way, Stroll also covers the theories of Rudolf Carnap, W. V. O. Quine, Gilbert Ryle, J. L. Austin, Hilary Putnam, Saul Kripke, John Searle, Ruth Marcus, and Patricia and Paul Churchland. Stroll�s approach to his subject treats the critical movements in analytic philosophy in terms of the philosophers who defined them. The notoriously complex realm of analytic philosophy emerges less as an abstract enterprise than as a domain of personalities and their competing methods and arguments. The book�s inventive presentations of complex logical doctrines relate them to the traditional problems of philosophy, seeking the continuity between them rather than polemical distinctions so as to bring the true differences of their respective achievements into sharper focus.</p><p>Avrum Stroll investigates the &#34;family resemblances&#34; between that impressive breed of thinkers known as analytic philosophers.

In these stories, the beloved detective uses razor-sharp logic and brilliant analytical reasoning to rescue a king from blackmail, find a missing fianc�, infiltrate an opium den, and solve many other mysteries.

Much of Kleist's effect is produced by his highly idiosyncratic and expressive syntax and language, and David Constantine's translation brilliantly reproduces his strangeness in English.</p><p>Kleist was born in Frankfurt in 1777. He broke with his family&#39;s military tradition to devote himself to literature. An admirer of Napoleon, he was imprisoned, suspected of being a spy. In his last years he was always short of moneWhen he died in 1811 at the age of 34, Kleist left behind a corpus of works that, while small in quantity, were and still are among the finest German texts. This volume includes the majority of Kleist's writings in English translation. An outstanding representation of his work, this selection offers three plays, eight short stories, five anecdotes, and three essays. Kleist's dramas and stories resonate with complex circumstances and obscure consequences that the characters struggle to sail through. Things are not always what they seem to be; intriguingly, the guilty can look innocent and the innocent guilty. The play The Broken Jug, as well as the stories "Michael Kohlhaas" and "The Chilean Earthquake," depict predicaments of the falsely accused who are denied justice. Constantine, a fellow at Queen's College, Oxford, does an outstanding job of conveying the beauty of Kleist's literary style while allowing himself some liberties in translation.

He died in Europe in 1958.Grade 6 Up Ballads have strong rhythms, and the texts of such epic tales as Dan McGrew (and Harrison's The Cremation of Sam McGee Greenwillow, 1987) are humane in their exposition of our heroic qualities and artful in the choice and composition of language. This poem is an anecdote from the days of the gold camps in Alaska. Service, writing in 1907, played up the melodrama using all of the props of a sort of Last Chance Saloon for his stage. Harrison employs opaque paints in relatively untextured areas frequently outlined thickly with contrasting color lines. There's a hint of Lautrec's posters at times. Saloon interiors provide sufficient details to draw readers in. And the impressionistic rainbow-like swirls of blues, purples, and yellows carry them through the boozy dream-cum-nightmares of a miner's psyche as he finds a return to ``civilization'' more than he can handle. The design in uncluttered: the pristine glossy white left-hand pages house the verses set in a large serifed typeface, and opposite are the black-framed pictures. Words and pictures make a strong pair. A plausible fantasy, attractive in its trim narrative setting.

His paintings range from figurative work addressing civil rights in the 1960s to groundbreaking experimentation with abstraction in the '70s, '80s and '90s to recent work memorializing black historical figures such as James Baldwin and W.E.B. Du Bois.</p><p>Whitten began carving wood in the 1960s in order to understand African sculpture, both aesthetically and in terms of his own identity as an African American, and continued developing this practice throughout his life. For the first time ever, these revelatory works are collected in Odyssey, accompanying a landmark exhibition coorganized by the Baltimore Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p><p>Odyssey features the sculptures made by Whitten over the past 50 years, as well as the <i>Black Monolith</i> series of paintings, and Whitten's own archival photographs documenting his life and process. The catalog includes major new texts from exhibition curators Katy Siegel and Kelly Baum, as well as contributions from philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah, art historians Richard Shiff and Kellie Jones, a lengthy biographical interview with Whitten by art historian Courtney J. Martin and the essay "Why Do I Carve Wood?" by the artist himself.</p><p>Gorgeously illustrated with hundreds of illustrations and never-before-published photographs, <i>Odyssey</i> is a landmark exploration of one of the most significant artists of the 20th century, and a monument to a life and career that, as described by the <i>Washington Post</i>, "enriched the abstract tradition in Western art with fresh political and spiritual content."</p></p><p>Now Whitten, speaking as it were from beyond the grave, has given his audience a kind of double surprise. (Sanford Schwartz <i>The New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>His objects in carved wood and found materials revisit and reclaim the forms, rituals and spirituality of African sculpture. (Roberta Smith <i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>During decades of summers on Crete, [Whitten] carved and embellished extraordinary wooden sculptures, magisterial wonders in wild cypress, black mulberry, cherry, olive, and oak, whose mysteries are heightened with the addition of fish bones, seashells, spark plugs, rusted nails, hidden compartments. (Andrea K Scott <i>The New Yorker</i>)<br><br>A gorgeous, loquacious exhibition. (Roberta Smith <i>The New York Times</i>)<br><br>Whitten repurposed traditional forms with the same ease that marked his movement between modes of visual representation. (Albert Mobilio <i>Bookforum</i>)<br><br>"Whitten saw interconnected environmental, technological, and political crises looming&#x2015;and while, in his art, he often reached back into the past, he also projected into the future, imagining how we could protect ourselves from ruin."

In <em>Not a Suicide Pact</em>, Judge Richard A. Posner offers a cogent and elegant response to these protests, arguing that personal liberty must be balanced with public safety in the face of grave national danger. <br><br> Critical of civil libertarians who balk at any curtailment of their rights, even in the face of an unprecedented terrorist threat in an era of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, Posner takes a fresh look at the most important constitutional issues that have arisen since 9/11. These issues include the constitutional rights of terrorist suspects (whether American citizens or not) to habeas corpus and due process, and their rights against brutal interrogation (including torture) and searches based on less than probable cause. Posner argues that terrorist activity is <em>sui</em> <em>generis</em>--it is neither "war" nor "crime"--and it demands a tailored response, one that gives terror suspects fewer constitutional rights than persons suspected of ordinary criminal activity. Constitutional law must remain fluid, protean, and responsive to the pressure of contemporary events. Posner stresses the limits of law in regulating national security measures and underscores the paradoxical need to recognize a category of government conduct that is at once illegal and morally obligatory.<br><br> One of America's top legal thinkers, Posner does not pull punches. He offers readers a short, sharp book with a strong point of view that is certain to generate much debate. <br><br>OXFORD'S NEW INALIENABLE RIGHTS SERIES<br><br>This is inaugural volume in Oxford's new fourteen-book Inalienable Rights Series.

Posner</strong> is Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, and lectures at the University of Chicago Law School. He is the author of many books and articles, including <em>Overcoming Law</em> and <em>An Affair of State</em>, both of which were picked by <em>The New York Times Book Review</em> as among the best books of their year.<br><br>"A welcome voice in the national debate about freedom vs. security."--<em>The Washington Post Book World</em><p></p><br>"...Posner's reasoning...is invariably illuminating, and overall demonstrates that the Constitution, pragmatically interpreted, is both sturdy and flexible, capable in the war we are now waging of protecting liberty and maintaining security."--<em>Weekly Standard</em><p></p><br>"Posner's new book, <em>Not A Suicide Pact</em>, is characteristically hawkish...Reader either will or won't share Posner's predilection to trust the government in dire-seeming times; there is certainly much to be said on the other side...Posner is far more provocative and surprising when he reveals the limits of his trust."--<em>New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Known for his willfully provocative opinions...the positions he takes in this volume will not only fuel his own controversial reputation but also underscore just how negotiable constitutional rights have become in the eyes of administration proponents."--<em>The New York Times</em><p></p><br>"...Posner's reasoning...is invariably illuminating, and overall demonstrates that the Constitution, pragmatically interpreted, is both sturdy and flexible, capable in the war we are now waging of protecting liberty and maintaining security."--<em>Weekly Standard</em><p></p><br>"His views will provoke Category 5 protest from civil libertarians.... He ably makes the case for his side in the national debate."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Undaunted by controversy, Posner forthrightly addresses detention, harsh interrogation methods, limits of free speech, ethnic profiling, and the boundaries of privacy rights, among other hot-button topics.

Mr. Ho also includes useful information on resources for further study.<br><br>Unlike many language-learning books these days, the content is not in any way dumbed down. The grammar content is clear but demanding.<br><br>Some not terribly significant gripes: there are too many exercises that are subjective, where you respond in terms of your own experience, and that therefore have no answers.

S. Sokolnikoff.</p><p></p><h2>Encyclopedia of Murder and Mystery</h2><p>An indispensable reference for lovers of the mystery genre looks at mystery writers, famous and lesser known, in an A-to-Z format, and offers a cross-referenced catalog of titles, characters, movie adaptations, and much more.</p><p>The world of mystery and crime fiction has been the subject of a numerous recent reference tomes, from Willetta Heising's excellent <i>Detecting Women</i> and <i>Detecting Men</i> to <i>The Oxford Companion to Crime and Mystery Writing</i>. The former books are notable for their comprehensive cataloging of contemporary writers, and the latter succeeds by its reliance on a diverse range of authorities. But Bruce Murphy's <i>The Encyclopedia of Murder and Mystery</i> is much more a reader's book. <p> Murphy is himself a bibliophile to be reckoned with, as editor of <i>Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia</i> and writer for <i>Critical Inquiry</i> and the <i>Paris Review</i>. What he brings to his reference work, however, is not just the requisite expertise but also a sense of his audience, an attention to prose style, and a passion for mystery as a genre. He writes in his introduction: "The crime story is about consequences. In the mystery novel, infidelity leads to murder; in the 'serious' novel, more often than not it leads merely to divorce and the opportunities for characters to feel sorry for themselves." Throughout, Murphy throws himself into controversy and immerses himself in the minutiae that has always drawn the attention of true mystery fans. Where else might one find, for example, a description of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple tales as requiring "willing suspension of disbelief, because St. Mary Meade seems to have a crime rate to rival Raymond Chandler's Los Angeles. They are also oozing with charm and can be a bit treacly."</p><p> The book does fall short in a few areas. Most notably, there are no illustrations, even where a photograph or an etching might be appropriate--especially in relation to film. Also, given that the book is all the product of a single author, some areas are given less weight than might be expected (e.g., Batman, who warranted a major feature in <i>Encyclopedia Mysteriosa</i>, is omitted). Further, the book's great strength--its critical bent--might be seen as a drawback to some fans. For example, the entry on "cozy" treats the subgenre with some disdain, especially dismissing cat mysteries where "realism is not so much ignored as belligerently violated." This criticism, however, points again to why this volume is such a pleasure to read. Murphy chooses to embrace the difficult subjects and let his reader know what he thinks. You will learn from his vast research and--like him or hate him--you will find him entertaining. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>I loved writing this book and researching it, and wrote it for people who also are fascinated with mystery stories and everything to do with them--it&#39;s not just a dry list of famous names and titles. This book is meant to be browsed and read for pleasure, not just to look up a date. For example, I got interested in the &#34;Case of the Poisoned Umbrella,&#34; a real murder that occured on the streets of London in 1978, and which inspired John D. MacDonald&#39;s Travis McGee novel entitled The Green Ripper. There&#39;s also an entry on ricin, the poison used in the umbrella case--so the book leads you from one related topic to another. If you don&#39;t remember how cyanide works or where the derringer pistol came from, you can look it up here; if you want a list of baseball, golf, or amnesia mysteries, there is an entry. Whereas most mystery reference works don&#39;t make room to discuss individual books, I wrote short essays on famous novels and stories, lost classics (it&#39;s amazing ho! w many of these you can find in old bookshops), and little gems like &#34;The Two Bottles of Relish.&#34; There are also entries on characters, from real ones like Jack the Ripper and Landru (the 20th century&#39;s scariest serial killer) to Philip Marlowe and Jim Wormold (from Graham Greene&#39;s Our Man in Havana). I give my real opinions of works and writers--sometimes negative--but I also give my reasons, because I think readers want a point of view that they can think about and agree or disagree with, and not just an &#34;objective&#34; summary. Criticism is a dialogue, after all.</p><h2>The One Year Daily Moments of Strength: Inspiration for Men</h2><p><b>Today, spend time with God that will fill your spirit with strength.</b><br><i>The One Year Daily Moments of Strength</i> will help you experience a deeper and more powerful connection with the Lord each day.<br><br>Complete with Bible verses, helpful explanations, and practical applications, these short daily devotions, covering a variety of everyday issues, will help strengthen your commitment to faith and your walk with God.

But most people don&#39;t realize that in addition to transporting an awesome air arsenal, each of these ocean-going cities prowls the high seas with an entourage of up to 15 additional vessels. In the event of hostilities, these &#34;carrier battle groups&#34; allow nothing to violate their personal space-areas often measured in hundreds of square miles. The individual roles of nuclear submarines, the cruisers that coordinate carrier-based air power, the aircraft themselves, anti-submarine vessels and, of course, the carriers are all discussed and depicted in exclusive action photography. In addition, author Steve Tomajczyk addresses criticisms of carriers as wasteful and outmoded; explains how a carrier battle group-the U.S. Navy&#39;s most powerful operating unit-defends itself from attacks; and compares the firepower wielded by a typical carrier battle group to that of potential adversaries.</p><p></p><h2>Language, Context, and Text: Aspects of Language in a Social-Semiotic Perspective (Language Education)</h2><p>This study deals with the linguistic study of texts as a way of understanding how language functions in its immensely varied range of social contexts.

Here too are selections from Swift's poetry and portions of his Journal to Stella. Swift's savage ridicule, corrosive wit, and sparkling humor are fully displayed in this comprehensive collection.</p><h2>Dissolution: Sovereignty and the Breakup of the Soviet Union (The Soviet Bloc and After)</h2><p>In December 1991, the Soviet Union passed into history as a legal entity, breaking apart into15 successor states. This clear and convincing book explains why. Walker argues against much of the conventional wisdom and scholarly literature on the breakup, which emphasizes what he calls the &#39;demand side&#39; of the problem, or the role of nationalist mobilization and the rise of separatist aspirations in the USSR&#39;s union republics. He points out that support for dissolution was limited to a handful of republics that included only a small portion of the Soviet population. Instead, the author highlights the critical role played by the USSR&#39;s ethno-federal system, as well as the normative claims and legitimizing myths of Soviet nationality policy. These institutions and myths empowered the anti-union opposition even in those union republics where they had limited support, and they help account for the highly ineffective strategy that Gorbachev adopted to overcome the USSR&#39;s &#39;nationality crisis.&#39; Walker also shows how confusion over the meaning of some of the key terms of Soviet political discourse during perestroika-particularly &#39;sovereignty&#39; but also &#39;union,&#39; &#39;federation,&#39; &#39;confederation,&#39; and &#39;independence&#39;-contributed to a &#39;fog of war&#39; that helped bring about the full disintegration of the USSR, an outcome that surprisingly few desired.</p><p><b>Edward W.

The scholarship is excellent; the tone, the balance, and the fairness of Walker's judgments are commendable. (Ronald Grigor Suny, William H. Sewell Jr. Distinguished University Professor of History and Political Science, University of Michigan)<br><br>The demise of the Soviet Union remains a mystery for both politicians and scholars not only in the West but in Russia as well. Explaining this dramatic event, Edward Walker separates the dissolution of an ethno-territorial state from the death of socialism as a regime type. In his intriguing story, he addresses the deep causes of the breakup and shows the shortcomings of the Soviet ethno-federal system. Walker's compelling analysis of Gorbachev's efforts to save the collapsing is convincing. This book is a first class scholarly contribution to the study of one of the most perplexing events of the 20th century. (Vitaly Naumkin, International Center for Strategic and Political Studies)<br><br>[This book] draws deserved attention to a set of factors all too often neglected in studies of Soviet disintegration.

But for many people in different cultures, mathematics is not simply something they learn in school but something they do as an intrinsic part of their everyday lives. This book is a guide for teachers who would like to enhance their mathematics instruction by integrating it with examples and activities from cultures throughout the world. It provides culturally situated examples, each linked to Common Core objectives that show how mathematics can be so much more than a story problem or an exercise in a worksheet with little or no context. The eleven chapters provide a range of activities from around the world that teach students key math concepts while introducing them to a diversity of cultures. For example: In a Mayan village in Guatemala, students use math as a means to increase the traditional corn harvest Traditional symbols stamped on cloth in Ghana spark an exploration of geometry, measurement, and data analysis Embroidery patterns from Bulgaria can help younger students learn about patterns, and introduce older students to fractal geometry Klappenspiel, a popular classroom game in Germany, provides a fun application of probability analysis Each chapter has activities for specific grade bands (K-3, 4-8, and 9-12), and all activities are designed to encourage students to discover connections among math concepts, world cultures, and their own daily lives and communities.</p><p>Jim Barta is professor and dean of the College of Health Sciences and Human Ecology at Bemidji State University, USA.

From his perspective as a historian of religions, the eminent scholar Mircea Eliade shows that such popular trends develop from archaic roots and periodically resurface in certain myths, symbols, and rituals. In six lucid essays collected for this volume, Eliade reveals the profound religious significance that lies at the heart of many contemporary cultural vogues.<br> <br> Since all of the essays except the last were originally delivered as lectures, their introductory character and lively oral style make them particularly accessible to the intelligent nonspecialist. Rather than a popularization, <i>Occultism, Witchcraft, and Cultural Fashions</i> is the fulfillment of Eliade's conviction that the history of religions should be read by the widest possible audience.<br></p></p><p><b>Mircea Eliade</b> (1907-1986) was the Sewell L.

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.The Red Badge of Courage was published in 1895, when its author, an impoverished writer living a bohemian life in New York, was only twenty-three. It immediately became a bestseller, and Stephen Crane became famous. Crane set out to create "a psychological portrayal of fear." Henry Fleming, a Union Army volunteer in the Civil War, thinks "that perhaps in a battle he might run....As far as war was concerned he knew nothing of himself." And he does run in his first battle, full of fear and then remorse. He encounters a grotesquely rotting corpse propped against a tree, and a column of wounded men, one of whom is a friend who dies horribly in front of him. Fleming receives his own "red badge" when a fellow soldier hits him in the head with a gun.

He founded a community of lay people who shared his vision and from this small beginning has grown. <br><br>The World Community for Christian Meditation which today is active in numerous countries around the world and has thousands of members and associates. Its work, and its emphasis on meditation, derives directly from the Benedictine focus on prayer and lectio divina or holy reading. <br><br>Right up to the end of his life in 1982, John Main wrote a series of remarkable letters of spiritual direction to WCCM's growing family. Two collections have previously been published and are now out of print and the complete letters are now published in this single volume. Together they constitute a volume of remarkable spiritual wisdom and insight, as fresh and relevant for today as when they were first written.</p><p>LAURENCE FREEMAN osb is a Benedictine monk who worked with John Main from the beginning and is very much his successor.</p><h2>Logistics &amp; Supply Chain Management</h2><p><p>Effective development and management of a supply chain network is an invaluable source of sustainable advantage in today&#x2019;s turbulent global marketplace, where demand is difficult to predict and supply chains need to be more flexible as a result.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This updated 4th edition of the bestselling <i>Logistics and Supply Chain Management</i> is a clear-headed guide to all the key topics in an integrated approach to supply chains, including:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>� The link between logistics and customer value.</p> <p>� Logistics and the bottom line measuring costs and performance.</p> <p>� Creating a responsive supply chain.</p> <p>� Managing the global pipeline.</p> <p>� Managing supply chain relationships.</p> <p>� Managing risk in the supply chain.</p> <p>� Matching supply and demand.</p> <p>� Creating a sustainable supply chain.</p> <p>� Product design in the supply chain.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Effective development and management of your supply chain network will cut your costs and enhance your customer value.

It provides a stimulating overview of current medieval historiography, demonstrating that history is not a collection of static facts, but rather a dynamic process of interpretation. <p>The book is structured thematically under four key areas of scholarly discussion. Chapter 1, "The Fate of Rome's Western Provinces" explores current thinking about the age that used to be called the "decline of Rome". Chapter 2, "Feudalism and Its Alternatives", examines the debate on the very term' feudalism', which some historians would like to jettison altogether. The discussion in Chapter 3, "Gender", turns to the rich array of studies about women (and men as defined as a gender category) that have been written in the last 20 years. In the final chapter, "Religion and Society", the book highlights new ways in which medieval historians are connecting religious phenomena as diverse as formal doctrine, belief in miracles, and liturgical proliferations to transformations and preoccupations within secular society.</p> <p>Each section comprises an introduction by the editors, discussing the significance of the topic and the history of its interpretation. There follows, for each, five to six readings from books or articles that reflect some of the most important current scholarship in the field. Several pieces are here translated into English for the first time.</p><b>Barbara H. Rosenwein</b> is Professor of History at Loyola University Chicago.

The question is: How do you learn to go with the flow and let your true nature guide you?</p><p>Chapter by chapter, <em>The Purpose of Your Life</em> explains how to locate the source of your innate energy and focus it, how to align yourself with the natural forces that swirl around us always, and how to develop the intuition that fosters synchronicity. The book is packed with illuminating anecdotes and profiles of fascinating people -- from artists to urban planners to Zen masters -- who describe how they found their own purposes. There are practical exercises throughout, along with charts, self-questionnaires, and other tools that help you understand yourself and your deepest aspirations.</p><p>As you learn to recognize and trust the voice of intuition, you'll find new doors opening and new possibilities everywhere. You'll feel invigorated by the potential you've unleashed, a power that will only grow with each new accomplishment. And you'll discover the serenity and satisfaction that come only to those who are living life to the fullest. The Force is with you -- all you have to do is reach out and start to use it.</p><p></p></p><p>Spirituality, optimism, career planning, and self-help neatly blend together in this highly useful guidebook on living one's true purpose. Step by step, Adrienne shows readers how to discover one's calling (learning how to take advantage of synchronicity, intuition, and "uncommon sense") and organize life accordingly. This coauthor of <i>The Celestine Prophecy</i> does not promise a payoff of material wealth or worldly fame. Rather, she suggests that "writing your own job description" and "doing the dream" will result in a more spiritual and meaningful life. Her most impressive leadership comes in the section called "Deep Water," where she addresses the obstacles and suffering that frequently block the path to enlightenment. --<i>Gail Hudson</i>Carol Adrienne is the author of <em> The Purpose of Your Life</em> and <em> The Numerology Kit</em>.

Concerned with the shape and position of surfaces in an optical system, optomechanics is a subfield of physics that is arguably as old as optics. However, while universities offer courses on the subject, there is a scarcity in textbook selections that skillfully and properly convey optomechanical fundamentals to aspiring engineers. Complemented by tutorial examples and exercises, this textbook rectifies this issue by providing instructors and departments with a better choice for transmitting to students the basic principles of optomechanics and allowing them to comfortably gain familiarity with the field&#x2019;s content. Practicing optical engineers who engage in self-study and wish to enhance the extent of their knowledge will also find benefit from the vast experience of the authors. The book begins with a discussion of materials based on optomechanical figures of merit and features chapters on windows, prisms, and lenses. The authors also cover topics related to design parameter, mounting small mirrors, metal mirrors with a discussion of infrared applications, and kinematic design. Overall, <i>Fundamentals of Optomechanics</i> outfits students and practitioners with a stellar foundation for exploring the design and support of optical system surfaces under a wide variety of conditions. </p> <p></p> <ul> <p> </p><li>Provides the fundamentals of optomechanics</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Presents self-contained, student-friendly prose, written by top scientists in the field</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Discusses materials, windows, individual lenses and multiple lenses</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Includes design, mounting, and performance of mirrors </li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Includes homework problems and a solutions manual for adopting professors </li> <p></p></ul></p><p><p>Paul Yoder (BS physics, Juniata College, Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, 1947, and MS physics, Penn State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, 1950) learned optical design and opto-mechanical engineering at the U.S. Army&#x2019;s Frankford Arsenal (1951&#x2013;1961). He then applied those skills at Perkin-Elmer Corporation (1961&#x2013;1986) and served the optical community as a consultant in optical and opto-mechanical engineering (1986&#x2013;2006). A fellow of the OSA and SPIE, Yoder has authored numerous chapters on opto-mechanics, published more than 60 papers, been awarded 14 U.S. and several foreign patents, and taught more than 75 short courses for SPIE, U.S. government agencies, and industry.</p> <p>Daniel Vukobratovich is senior principal multidisciplinary engineer at Raytheon Systems, Tucson, Arizona, and adjunct professor at the University of Arizona. He has authored more than 50 papers, taught short courses in opto-mechanics in 12 different countries, and consulted for more than 40 companies. A SPIE fellow, he is a founding member of the opto-mechanics working group. He holds international patents and received an IR-100 award for work on metal matrix composite optical materials. He led development on a series of ultra-lightweight telescopes using new materials, and worked on space telescope systems for STS-95, Mars Observer, Mars Global Surveyor, and FUSE.</p><p>"This book addresses a pressing need for tools to teach optomechanical engineering at the University level. It also serves as a valuable reference work for practicing engineers.

Hatheway Incorporated, Pasadena, California, USA</p> <p>"This book was written by the two most renowned specialists in optomechanics. The text is skillfully written to be understood easily while covering all the most important aspect of the optomechanical field. The material presented in the book is backed up with tutorial examples and exercises, thus distinguishing itself from other reference books in optomechanics intended to be used by practicing engineers.

Doyle, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, Massachusetts, United States</p> <p>"Yoder and Vukobratovich do an exceptional job of creating content that is introductory at heart, but thorough enough to be useful and practical in application. It is unusual to get an engineering perspective woven into theory but they skillfully include both. Optomechanics is such a critical cross-discipline field for optics and it is unfortunately woefully underserved by the talent pipeline. An introductory text like this would be well-served to be on shelves of both optical and mechanical engineers in order to address the gap between the two disciplines."<br>&#x2015;Katie Schwertz, Edmund Optics, Tucson, Arizona, USA</p> <p>"The book would be ideal as a textbook for graduate students with some knowledge of both optics and mechanical engineering, or for practitioners in the field."</p> <p>--Bogdan Hoanca, a professor of management information systems at the University of Alaska Anchorage, USA</p></p><h2>The Self</h2><p>Although social psychology has been traditionally focused on interpersonal relationships, the cognitive revolution in psychology has had the effect of refocusing some social psychology on intra-psychic processes. This area of psychology has become very popular in recent years, yet there is currently no other textbook available for the study of the self.&nbsp; Republished in its original form by Psychology Press in 2007, this book carefully documents the changing conceptions and the value accorded the self in psychology over time. It further outlines the many alternative conceptions of this increasingly central domain in social psychology. New research and conceptions are juxtaposed with the classic and traditional, providing the reader with a comprehensive introduction to the study of the self.</p><p>University of Washington, USA</p><h2>An Anthology of Modern Irish Poetry</h2><p>Never before has there been a single-volume anthology of modern Irish poetry so significant and groundbreaking as <i>An Anthology of Modern Irish Poetry</i>. Collected here is a comprehensive representation of Irish poetic achievement in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, from poets such as Austin Clarke and Samuel Beckett who were writing while Yeats and Joyce were still living; to those who came of age in the turbulent &#x2019;60s as sectarian violence escalated, including Seamus Heaney and Michael Longley; to a new generation of Irish writers, represented by such diverse, interesting voices as David Wheatley (born 1970) and Sin�ad Morrissey (born 1972).<br>Scholar and editor <b>Wes Davis</b> has chosen work by more than fifty leading modern and contemporary Irish poets. Each poet is represented by a generous number of poems (there are nearly 800 poems in the anthology). The editor&#x2019;s selection includes work by world-renowned poets, including a couple of Nobel Prize winners, as well as work by poets whose careers may be less well known to the general public; by poets writing in English; and by several working in the Irish language (Gaelic selections appear in translation). Accompanying the selections are a general introduction that provides a historical overview, informative short essays on each poet, and helpful notes&#x2015;all prepared by the editor.</p><p>Wes Davis is a former Assistant Professor of English at Yale University.

Against a background of administrative and financial scandal, Dickens tells the moving story of the old Marshalsea prisoner who inherits a fortune and his devoted daughter's love for a man who believes he has done with love. He draws widely on the events of his own life and times, yet focuses a powerful imaginative vision which is as universal as it is specific, immediate, and intense. In Little Dorrit Dickens displays his characteristic mastery of irony and pathos, of satire and comedy, and the novel exemplifies his most mature, ambitious, and effective writing.<br>This edition, which has the definitive Clarendon text, also includes Dickens's working notes and eight of the original illustrations from the first edition by 'Phiz'.</p><p>The classic, definitive, world-famous Nonesuch Press edition of 1937, finally available again and bound in leather and linen.

The Nonesuch edition contains full-color illustrations selected by Dickens himself, by artists including Hablot Knight Browne ("Phiz"), George Cruikshank, John Leech, Robert Seymour, and George Cattermole.<br><br> <i>The Nonesuch Dickens</i> reproduces the original elegance of these beautiful editions. Books are printed on natural cream-shade high quality stock, quarter bound in bonded leather with cloth sides, include a ribbon marker, and feature special printed endpapers. Each volume is wrapped in a protective, clear acetate jacket.<br><br> The books are available as individual volumes, or as sets. The six-volume set contains <i>Oliver Twist, Bleak House, Christmas Books, Nicholas Nickleby, David Copperfield,</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i> together with <i>Hard Times</i>. The three-volume set contains <i>A Tale of Two Cities, Little Dorrit,</i> and <i>The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.Of the complex, richly rewarding masterworks he wrote in the last decade of his life, Little Dorrit is the book in which Charles Dickens most fully unleashed his indignation at the fallen state of mid-Victorian society. Crammed with persons and incidents in whose recreation nothing is accidental or spurious, containing, in its picture of the Circumlocution Office, the most witheringly exact satire of a bureaucracy we possess, Little Dorrit is a stunning example of how thoroughly Dickens could put his flair for the theatrical and his comic genius the service of his passion for justice.</p><h2>Telecult Power: The Amazing New Way to Psychic and Occult Wonders</h2><p>Telecult Power is a method you can use to bring about any goal you have - whether it be for wealth, love, or power - quickly, easily, by unobserved means.

The very idea seems paradoxical. And yet, if we conceive of "seeing" as the ability to generate internal mental representations that may contain visual details, the idea of blind vision becomes a concept subject to investigation. In this book, Zaira Cattaneo and Tomaso Vecchi examine the effects of blindness and other types of visual deficit on the development and functioning of the human cognitive system. Drawing on behavioral and neurophysiological data, Cattaneo and Vecchi analyze research on mental imagery, spatial cognition, and compensatory mechanisms at the sensorial, cognitive, and cortical levels in individuals with complete or profound visual impairment. They find that our brain does not need our eyes to "see."</p><p>Cattaneo and Vecchi address critical questions of broad importance: the relationship of visual perception to imagery and working memory and the extent to which mental imagery depends on normal vision; the functional and neural relationships between vision and the other senses; the specific aspects of the visual experience that are crucial to cognitive development or specific cognitive mechanisms; and the extraordinary plasticity of the brain&#x2015;as illustrated by the way that, in the blind, the visual cortex may be reorganized to support other perceptual or cognitive funtions. In the absence of vision, the other senses work as functional substitutes and are often improved. With <i>Blind Vision</i>, Cattaneo and Vecchi take on the "tyranny of the visual," pointing to the importance of the other senses in cognition.</p></p><p>Zaira Cattaneo is a Research Scientist at the University of Milano-Bicocca.<p>I would highly recommend <i>Blind Vision: The Neuroscience of Visual Impairment</i>....

Considering neglected but important aspects of Gramsci's thought and correcting a number of mistaken interpretations, Femia demonstrates that Gramsci's work contains the prospect of a more humane and democratic alternative to Leninist Communism.</p><p></p><h2>Spirituality of the Body: Bioenergetics for Grace and Harmony</h2><p>Links the western concept of relation to a Supreme Being, the Eastern tradition connecting spirit and breathing, and the bioenergetic connection of psychic peace and free-flowing physical energy</p><p>Lamenting the split between mind and body that has scarred Western spiritual life, psychoanalyst Lowen claims that spiritual and physical healing happens in a state of grace, when the ego and the body are harmoniously reunited. Lowen argues that repressed emotions cause muscular tension, more often than not stretching this argument too far. For example, nearsightedness is presented as an emotional rather than a physical condition: "When feeling is expressed through the eyes, vision always improves." Broad generalizations abound, conclusions are drawn on slim evidence, and much of the content is a rehash of Lowen's Bioenergetics . The latter chapters dealing with love, faith, and graciousness are refreshing and insightful, but as a whole this work is recommended only for the most ardent adherents of alternative healing.<br><i>- Amy A.

Written by a leading scholar of world Christianity, the book traces how Christianity evolved from a religion defined by the culture and politics of Europe to the expanding polycentric and multicultural faith it is today--one whose growing popular support is strongest in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, China, and other parts of Asia.</p><p>Brian Stanley sheds critical light on themes of central importance for understanding the global contours of modern Christianity, illustrating each one with contrasting case studies, usually taken from different parts of the world. Unlike other books on world Christianity, this one is not a regional survey or chronological narrative, nor does it focus on theology or ecclesiastical institutions. Rather, Stanley provides a history of Christianity as a popular faith experienced and lived by its adherents, telling a compelling and multifaceted story of Christendom's fortunes in Europe, North America, and across the rest of the globe.</p><p>Transnational in scope and drawing on the latest scholarship, <i>Christianity in the Twentieth Century</i> demonstrates how Christianity has had less to fear from the onslaughts of secularism than from the readiness of Christians themselves to accommodate their faith to ideologies that privilege racial identity or radical individualism.</p></p><p><p> "Stanley's excellent book makes an original contribution to the history of modern Christianity.

More than just the study of numbers, mathematics provides us with the eyes to recognise and describe the hidden patterns of life. Supported with a variety of examples including - what keeps a jumbo jet in the air, how we forecast the weather and predict changes in the stock market, Devlin shows how mathematics can be used to describe and explain the world about us.</p><p>Keith Devlin is trying to be the Carl Sagan of mathematics, and he is succeeding. He writes: "Though the structures and patterns of mathematics reflect the structure of, and resonate in, the human mind every bit as much as do the structures and patterns of music, human beings have developed no mathematical equivalent of a pair of ears. Mathematics can be seen only with the eyes of the mind." All of his books are attempts to get around this problem, to "try to communicate to others some sense of what it is we experience--some sense of the simplicity, the precision, the purity, and the elegance that give the patterns of mathematics their aesthetic value."<p> <i>Life by the Numbers</i>, Devlin's companion book to the PBS series of the same name, is heavily illustrated and soothingly low on equations. But as he says, wanting mathematics without abstract notation "is rather like saying that Shakespeare would be much easier to understand if it were written in simpler language."</p><p> <i>The Language of Mathematics</i> is Devlin's second iteration of the approach he used in <i>Mathematics: The Science of Patterns</i>. It covers all the same ground (and uses many of the same words) as the latter, but with fewer glossy pictures, sidebars, and references. Devlin has also added chapters on statistics and on mathematical patterns in nature. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p>Keith Devlin is Dean of the School of Science at Saint Mary's College of California and Senior Researcher at Stanford University's Center for the Study of Language and Information.

A high school was needed, and Steiner wanted to provide a foundation for study and a guide for teachers already familiar with his approach to the human being, child development, and education based on spiritual science. <br><br>Steiner&#x2019;s education affirms the being of every child within the world of spirit. This approach works within the context of the child&#x2019;s gradual entry into earthly life, aided by spiritual forces, and children&#x2019;s need for an education that cooperates with those forces. <br><br>Some of Steiner&#x2019;s remarks may be controversial, but unbiased study will lead to an appreciation of the profound thought and wisdom behind what is presented here. <br><br>German source: <i>Menschenerkenntnis und Unterrichtsgestaltung</i> (GA 302).</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings.

In a wide-ranging and trenchant series of essays, articles, and documents, <i>Camille Saint-Sa�ns and His World</i> deconstructs the multiple realities behind the man and his music. Topics range from intimate glimpses of the private and playful Saint-Sa�ns, to the composer's interest in astronomy and republican politics, his performances of Mozart and Rameau over eight decades, and his extensive travels around the world. This collection also analyzes the role he played in various musical societies and his complicated relationship with such composers as Liszt, Massenet, Wagner, and Ravel. Featuring the best contemporary scholarship on this crucial, formative period in French music, <i>Camille Saint-Sa�ns and His World</i> restores the composer to his vital role as innovator and curator of Western music.</p><p>The contributors are Byron Adams, Leon Botstein, Jean-Christophe Branger, Michel Duchesneau, Katharine Ellis, Annegret Fauser, Yves G�rard, Dana Gooley, Carolyn Guzski, Carol Hess, D. Kern Holoman, L�o Houziaux, Florence Launay, St�phane Leteur�, Martin Marks, Mitchell Morris, Jann Pasler, William Peterson, Michael Puri, Sabina Teller Ratner, Laure Schnapper, Marie-Gabrielle Soret, Michael Stegemann, and Michael Strasser.</p></p><p><b>Jann Pasler</b> is professor of music at the University of California, San Diego. Her books include <i>Writing through Music: Essays on Music, Culture, and Politics</i> and <i>Composing the Citizen: Music as Public Utility in Third Republic France</i>."This compilation of masterful scholarship is likely to become a preeminent source for information on Saint-Sa�ns." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"[T]his book represents [quite an] achievement. Saint-Sa�ns is revealed and yet remains intensely private: the book speaks volumes on the composer's life, views, working methods, and cultural and social status."<b>---Clair Rowden, <i>H-France Review</i></b><br><br>"Jann Pasler's edited collection thus offers a significant contribution to Saint-Saens studies, and to the field of nineteenth- and early twentieth century French music as a whole."<b>---Helen Abbott, <i>French Studies</i></b><br><br>"This study of a versatile, tasteful and often endearing composer, and a serious, playful and sometimes prickly man, may be thoroughly recommended." (<i>Classical Music Magazine</i>)</p><h2>Among the Bears: Raising Orphaned Cubs in the Wild</h2><p><br>A first-person account of wild bear behavior that is both a thrilling animal story and a groundbreaking work of science.<br><br>In the spring of 1993, Ben Kilham, a naturalist who lives in the woodlands of New Hampshire, began raising a pair of orphaned wild black bears. The experience changed his life.<br><br>While spending thousands of hours with the cubs, Kilham discovered unknown facets of bear behavior that have radically revised our understanding of animal behavior. Now widely recognized for his contributions to wildlife science, Kilham reveals that bears are altruistic and cooperate with unrelated, even unknown individuals, while our closer relatives, the supposedly more highly evolved chimps, cooperate only within troops of recognizable members. <br><br>Kilham, who turned a disability, dyslexia, to his advantage as a naturalist, offers fascinating insights into the emotional life of bears. His work-which has been featured in several <i>National Geographic </i>television specials-also illustrates the powerful black bear intelligence that has survived bounties and overhunting to make them North America's dominant omnivore, familiar to every reader. Beyond the natural history, he introduces individual bears who become enthralling and memorable characters. <br><br>As in the bestselling books by Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey, <i>Among the Bears </i>explores the breaking down of mutual suspicion and building up of trust between species, with its hopeful implications for the shared future of humans and animals in the wild.<br><br></p><p>When naturalist Kilham was asked to take in two orphaned black bear cubs, the conventional wisdom was that he would end up with 200-pound brutes too dependent to leave home. So Kilham decided to try his own unconventional method--he raised them in their natural habitat, surrounded by the wild bear-filled woods of New Hampshire. As their bear mother, he was given an unprecedented look into the lives of bears and what he observed turns bear stereotypes on their head. Black bears exhibit behaviors thought to be found only in humans and great apes, such as an intricate system of communication and cooperation, insight, planning, deception, and even ethics, like fair play, empathy, and altruism (qualities not found in apes). Kilham, who has now raised 26 cubs, is an intrepid bear mom, and a humble and delightful storyteller. This is an irresistible story of some of the most endearing rogues ever encountered. <i>--Lesley Reed</i><br><b>Benjamin Kilham </b>is a woodsman and naturalist who over the past twenty-five years has discovered and then field-tested a new, exciting wildlife biology.

Snipping through the defensive wire and entering the base without alerting a single guard in a single perimeter bunker, they killed thirty U.S. soldiers and wounded eighty-two in a humiliating defeat that sounded the death knell for the reputation of the once proud U.S. Army in Vietnam.<br>Although one of the most famous actions of the war, it has never before received a full-scale account. Keith William Nolan has drawn on recently declassified documents and interviews with more than fifty veterans of the 1st Battalion of the 46th Infantry - the unit on Firebase Mary Ann - to recreate minute-by-minute the events of that night, as well as to understand how the military situation in the waning days of the Vietnam War allowed such a disaster to occur.</p><p>Keith William Nolan has published six previous books on the Vietnam War, including <i>Operation Buffalo</i> and <i>The Magnificent Bastards</i>. As a reviewer of one of his books said, "Nolan is a master of the personal interview. . . . He has the uncanny ability to convey not merely facts, but feelings." Nolan lives and writes in Webster Groves, Missouri.The battle took place on a remote hilltop in Quang Tin Province during the latter days of "Vietnamization," when open defiance of orders was common among GIs. What happened at Firebase Mary Ann the night of March 27-28, 1971, was, according to the author of this riveting account, the U.S. Army's "most blatant and humiliating defeat in Vietnam." That night, 50 sappers of the 409th Viet Cong Main Force Battalion, wearing nothing but shorts, slipped through the base's barbed wire without alerting a single sentry, killed 30 GIs and wounded 82 others. Relying on interviews with survivors and recently declassified documents, Nolan reconstructs the assault from start to finish, showing how a demoralized American unit (1st Battalion, 46th Infantry, Americal Division) was crushed, despite the heroic actions of a few individuals. He traces the chain-of-command process by which the defeat ruined the careers of the division and battalion commanders. By the author of The Magnificent Bastards, this is a perceptive study of poor leadership and combat demoralization. It is also a terrific battle book.

In the two centuries since is first appeared in France, the concept of ideology has undergone many transformations. It has been twisted, reformulated, recast, and finally filtered back into the everyday language of social and political life. Although there is much that is misleading and erroneous in the traditions of ideology, the author shows that it still defines a terrain of analysis that remains central to contemporary social sciences and continues to be the site of lively theoretical debate. The key to his analysis is what he terms the "mediazation" of the culture&#x2015;the general process by which the transmission of symbolic forms becomes increasingly reliant on the technical and institutional apparatuses of the media industries. Building on the work of Geertz and others, the author asserts that symbolic forms are embedded in such structured social contexts as power relations, forms of conflict, and inequalities in the distribution of resources, and that any discussion of mass communication must embrace its political as well as epistemological content.</p><p>&#x201c;This is a pathbreaking work which will undoubtedly become one of the fundamental texts in the theory of ideology.&#x201d;&#x2014;William Outhwaite, University of SussexJohn B.

What are the basic ingredients of reality? What is their ultimate nature? Could reality have been different? And where do human beings fit into reality? Indeed, why does reality contain anything at all? <br> <em>Riddles of Existence</em> is the first book ever to make metaphysics genuinely accessible and fun. Its lively, informal style brings these questions to life and shows how stimulating it can be to think about them. Earl Conee and Theodore Sider offer a lucid discussion of the major topics in metaphysics. What makes me the same person I was as a child? Is everything fated to be exactly as it is? Does time flow? How fast does it flow, and can one travel back in time, against the current? Does God exist? Why is there anything at all rather than nothing? If our actions are caused by things science can predict and control, how can we have free will? The authors approach these topics in an open-minded and undogmatic manner, giving readers a full sense of the issues involved. They don't try to convince us of their point of view. Instead, they hope that, by reading this book, we will come to appreciate the importance of such problems and develop reasoned opinions of your own. <br> <em>Riddles of Existence</em> shows that philosophy can be exciting and important, and understandable by anyone. No philosophical background is required to enjoy this book: anyone who has thought about life's most profound questions will find plenty to provoke and entertain them here.</p><p><br><strong>Earl Conee</strong> teaches philosophy at the University of Rochester. <strong>Theodore Sider</strong> teaches philosophy at Rutgers University.<br><br>"A series of hors d'oeuvres for intellectual diners.... The entertainment value lies in picking one's way through ingenious arguments, encountering along the way basic ideas like the law of the excluded middle and the principle of sufficient reason.... Mr. Conee and Mr. Sider like to start with a common-sense, real-life question--Why is the person in my baby picture the same as the person I see in the mirror today?--and then pick apart the comfortable assumptions that carry most of us through life.... The questions are big. Do things occur by accident or necessity? Do humans have free will? Why does anything exist? Nothing is resolved, but a lot is discussed, and some famous arguments, like St. Anselm's devilishly clever proof of the existence of God, are presented clearly and understandably."--William Grimes, <em>The New York Times</em><p></p><br></p><h2>A Traveler&#39;s Guide To Spacetime</h2><p>This innovative, inexpensive supplement will add a special dimension to any general physics class, or advanced course in special relativity.

The book uses open string pieces and tunes using the finger pattern 0-1-23-4, including 'C string specials'; extra pieces to give plenty of practice on the C string. Easy duets and a CD with performances of all of the pieces - bass and drums added for the jazz and rock numbers - make learning the viola fun. Piano accompaniments are provided in <em>Joggers Piano</em> <em>Book</em>.</p><p>Kathy Blackwell, B. Mus. (Hons.), LTCL, LGSM, studied music at Edinburgh University and continued with post-graduate studies in music at the University of Oxford. Kathy is a string teacher with many years experience of teaching violin and viola. She developed her teaching ideas at the coalface in both Music Services and in private practice, working with groups large and small and in one-to-one lessons. She was a strings consultant for the ABRSM Music Medals initiative, a new assessment specifically designed for students taught in groups, and a contributor to the accompanying book All together! Teaching Music in Groups (ABRSM, 2004). Her teaching experience has led her to co-author Fiddle, Viola, and Cello Time, published by Oxford University Press, with her husband, David. Kathy and David have presented workshops in the UK, Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. David Blackwell studied music at Edinburgh University, after which he pursued a career in music publishing, first at ABRSM and then at Oxford University Press. He is co-editor of OUP&#39;s In the Mood: 17 Jazz Classics for Choirs and Carols for Choirs 5, and has published a number of single choral arrangements. He is co-writer with his wife Kathy of OUP&#39;s award-winning string series, Fiddle, Viola, Cello Time, and String Time, which have twice won the MIA award for Best Educational Publication. He now works as a freelance music editor, composer and arranger. In 2017 Kathy and David Blackwell received two awards: from ESTA UK in recognition of their exceptional services to string teaching, and from the Oxfordshire Music Education Partnership for significant contribution to music education in Oxfordshire and beyond.The duet parts are nicely arranged and marked so that the student can start with the easier bottom part and come back later to play the top part. The range of musical genres is refreshing, covering everything from folk tunes to rock.The accompanying CD is what makes this book for me. Some pieces include a catchy drum kit and bass accompaniment that will have students tapping their toes as they enjoy keeping the beat! The piano accompaniments are also lovely and can be purchased in a separate volume. As well as being a good beginner book, Viola Time Joggers would also offer reading enrichment for a student learning by the Suzuki Method, or any other oral based training method . . . These delightful volumes are a wonderful compliment to any beginner violist study method. * Lisa Moody, Canadian Viola Society Newsletter Spring 07 * . . . Kathy Blackwell, an experienced fiddle teacher, has succeeded in her attempt to provide music for young children which is entertaining as well as instructive. * Tim Homfray The Strad Dec 2005 * [David and Kathy Blackwell] strive to provide accessible music that will inspire and instill musical self confidence in youngsters - and they succeed . . . Viola Time Joggers and Viola Time Runners deliver upbeat and playful tunes sure to appeal to viola upstarts . . . Both books are accompanied by well-produced, easy-to-follow CDs, a bonus for younger players, with musical styles varying from ragtime to the classics . . . These books are a good choice for teachers seeking pedagogy for their younger, first-time players. The whimsical cartoon illustrations coupled with fun, light music make for colorful curricula. * Heather K. Scott Strings June 06 (USA) * There are an impressive variety of styles within these simple pieces and a well-graded learning curve. Since many violists start out playing the violin, there is a relative lack of beginner-friendly publications, so these volumes will be welcomed by many viola teachers. The accompanying CD will allow enterprising pupils to further their instrumental progress and aural skills easily at home; a simple piano part is also available, and approximately a quarter of the pieces here are duets for pupil and teacher or two pupils. * Matthew Jones, Music Teacher June 06 *</p><h2>Student&#39;s Solutions Manual for Calculus for Biology and Medicine</h2><p>This manual contains completely worked-out solutions for all the odd-numbered exercises in the text.</p><p></p><h2>Parametric Modeling with SOLIDWORKS 2019</h2><p><p> Parametric Modeling with SOLIDWORKS 2019 contains a series of seventeen tutorial style lessons designed to introduce SOLIDWORKS 2019, solid modeling and parametric modeling techniques and concepts.

His contributions to the "New Archaeology" changed the course of the field, as he argued for the development of a scientifically rigorous framework to guide the excavation and interpretation of the archaeological record. This book, the culmination of Binford's intellectual legacy thus far, presents a detailed description of his methodology and its significance for understanding hunter-gatherer cultures on a global basis. This landmark publication will be an important step in understanding the great process of cultural evolution and will change the way archaeology proceeds as a scientific enterprise.<br><br>This work provides a major synthesis of an enormous body of cultural and environmental information and offers many original insights into the past. Binford helped pioneer what is now called "ethnoarchaeology"&#x2015;the study of living societies to help explain cultural patterns in the archaeological record&#x2015;and this book is grounded on a detailed analysis of ethnographic data from about 340 historically known hunter-gatherer populations. The methodological framework based on this data will reshape the paradigms through which we understand human culture for years to come.</p><p>"This is a very significant contribution to the field. . . . Many of the ideas presented in this book were foreshadowed in [Binford's] earlier work, but nowhere have they been developed as fully as they are here."&#x2015;James F. O'Connell, author of <i>A Prehistory of Australia, New Guinea, and Sahul</i><br><br>"This is a landmark work.

For two decades, a small but progressive group of visual artists, musicians, dancers, theater performers, and writers variously confronted the fraught legacy of World War II in Japan, which included occupation by a foreign power, growing economic inequality, and the clash between repressive social mores and an increasingly industrialized, urban, and consumer-oriented culture. <em>Art, Anti-Art, Non-Art</em> offers an introduction to this highly charged and innovative era in Japanese artistic practice.<br> Published in conjunction with an exhibition on view at the Getty Research Institute from March 6 to June 3, 2007, this catalogue features objects, books, periodicals, photographs, and other ephemera created by artists associated with Experimental Workshop, Gutai, High Red Centre, Neo Dada, Provoke, Tokyo Fluxus, and VIVO, among others.</p><p><br>BCharles Merewether is artistic director and curator of the 2006 Biennale of Sydney and a senior research fellow at the Centre for Cross-Cultural Research, Australian National University.<br> <br> <strong>Rika Iezumi Hiro</strong> is a research assistant at the Getty Research Institute.<br><p>&nbsp;"<i>Art, Anit-Art, Non-Art</i> presents a refreshing perspective on this period, integrating conceptual works with performances and records of happenings that have not been the focus of other postwar exhibitions to date."&#x2014;caa.reviews&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Lady of the Night: A Handbook of Moon Magick &amp; Rituals (Llewellyn's Modern Witchcraft)</h2><p>This book explores the lore, rituals and uni que magical potential associated with all the phases of the moon - full, waxing, waning, moonrise, moonset and dark and new phases - and suggests moon rituals that address one&#39;&#39;s ow n personal needs. &#39;</p><p>Edain became a self-initiated Witch in 1981 and has been an active part of the Pagan community since her formal initiation into a large San Antonio coven in 1983. &nbsp;Edain has researched alternative spiritualities since her teens, when she was first introduced to Kaballah, or Jewish mysticism. &nbsp;Since that time, she has studied a variety of magickal paths including Celtic, Appalachian folk magick, and Curanderismo, a Mexican-American folk tradition. &nbsp;Today, Edain is part of the Wittan Irish Pagan tradition, where she is a priestess of Brighid and an elder. &nbsp; <br> <br>An alumnus of the University of Texas with a BA in history, she is affiliated with several professional writer's organizations and occasionally presents workshops on magickal topics or works individually with students who wish to study Witchcraft. <br> <br>This former woodwind player for the Lynchburg (VA) Symphony claims both the infamous feuding McCoy family of Kentucky and Sir Roger Williams, the seventeeth-century religious dissenter, as branches on her ethnically diverse family tree. &nbsp;In her "real life," Edain works as a licensed stockbroker. <br> <br>Edain is the author of fifteen books, including Bewitchments; Enchantments; and her most recent release, Ostara: Customs, Spells &amp; Rituals for the Rites of Spring. <br> <br></p><h2>Merriam-Webster&#39;s Biographical Dictionary</h2><p>&#34;Comprehensive collection of concise biographies.

Caught in the gaze of a most unique eye were a cast of the soon-to-be-reckoned-with second-generation Hollywood, future legends, friends and family. Everyone hanging out, working together, crossing lines between fantasy and reality, fashion, film, art, music, and life. Brooke Hayward gave Dennis Hopper a camera in 1962, shortly after the birth of their daughter Marin, and it was with this gift that he documented all that went on in and around his eclectic, bohemian home. He photographed family and friends like Jane Fonda and Roger Vadim, artists like Jasper Johns, musicians like Ronnie Specter and Ike and Tina Turner, the early fashions of Rudi Gernreich, and on and on and on. 1712 North Crescent Heights, edited by Marin Hopper, designed by Dimitri Levas and including a conversation between Marin, Brooke Hayward and Dennis Hopper, is an intimate collection of never-before-seen photographs from this vibrant and uniquely personal time. A subtle glimpse into a brief but tantamount time in their lives. A time that would forever be lost with the arrival of Easy Rider.</p><p>Dennis Hopper is among the best-known film stars in the world. His acting career includes such credits as &#34;Rebel Without a Cause,&#34; &#34;Apocalypse Now,&#34; and &#34;Blue Velvet.&#34; His directing career has included such films as &#34;Easy Rider&#34; and &#34;The Last Movie.&#34; In addition to acting and directing, Hopper is a noted photographer, painter, and sculptor.

With a goal of making American history accessible, the authors</p> <p>offer a strong, clear narrative and provide the reader with the tools they need to understand history.</p> <br></p><p>PREFACE <p> The journey that led us to The American Journey began in the classroom with our students. We wrote this book for them and we kept their needs foremost as we set about preparing this second edition. </p><p> Over the years we have subjected our students to many American history books&#x2014;including the first edition of this one&#x2014;and they have let us know what they liked and disliked, what they found difficult and what they grasped easily, what they skipped and what they devoured. Most important, they have told us what connects history to their own experience and brings it alive. </p><p> Our goal is to make American history accessible to students. The key to that goal&#x2014;the core of the book&#x2014;is a strong clear narrative. American history is a compelling story and we seek to tell it in an engaging, forthright way. But we also provide students with an abundance of tools&#x2014;including outlines, key topics lists, chronologies, overview tables, highlighted key terms, review questions, and hundreds of maps, graphs, and illustrations&#x2014;to help them absorb that story and put it in context. We introduce them to the concerns of the .-participants in history with primary source documents. d, in a new feature called "America's Journey: From 'hen to Now," we connect events and issues from the Mast to the concerns of the present. </p><p> But if we wrote this book to appeal to our students, we also wrote it to engage their minds. We want to avoid academic trendiness, particularly the restricting categories that have divided the discipline of story over the last twenty years or so. We believe that e distinctions involved in the debates about multiculturalism and identity, between social and political history, between the history of the common people and history of the elite, are unnecessarily confusing. </p><p> What we seek is integration&#x2014;to combine political and social history, to fit the experience of particular groups into the broader perspective of the American past, to give voice to minor and major players alike because of their role in the story we have to tell. Approach </p><p> In telling our story, we had some definite ideas about what we might include and emphasize that other texts do not&#x2014;information we felt that the current and next generations of students will need to know about our past to function best in a new society. </p><p> CHRONOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION A Strong chronological backbone supports the book. We have found that the jumping back and forth in time characteristic of some American history textbooks confuses students. They abhor dates but need to know the sequence of events in history. A chronological presentation is the best way to be sure they do. </p><p> GEOGRAPHICAL LITERACY We also want students to be geographically literate. We expect them not only to know what happened in American history, but where it happened as well. Physical locations and spatial relationships were often important in shaping historical events. The abundant maps in The American Journey&#x2014;all numbered and called out in the text&#x2014;are an integral part of our story. </p><p> COVERAGE OF THE SOUTH AND WEST The South and the West play significant roles in this text. American history is too often written from a Northeastern perspective, at least when it comes to discussing cities, economic development, and reform. But not only were the South and West developing in their own ways throughout American history, they were and remain important keys to the emerging character of the nation as a whole. </p><p> POINT OF VIEW The American Journey presents a balanced overview of the American past. But "balanced" does not mean bland. We do not shy away from definite positions on controversial issues, such as the nature of early contacts between Native Americans and Europeans, why the politidcal crisis of the 1850s ended in a bloody Civil War, and how Populism and its followers fit into the American political spectrum. If students and instructors disagree, that's great; discussion and dissent are important catalysts for understanding and learning. </p><p> RELIGION Nor do we shy away from some topics that play relatively minor roles in other texts, like religion. Historians are often uncomfortable writing about religion and tend to slight its influence. This text stresses the importance of religion in American society both as a source of strength and a reflection of some its more troubling aspects. </p><p> Historians mostly write for each other. That's too bad. We need to reach out and expand our audience. An American history text is a good place to start. Our students are not only our future historians, but more important, our future. Let their American journey begin. Features of the Text </p><p> The American Journey includes an array of features and pedagogical tools designed to make American history accessible to students.</p><p>The Student Tool Kit that follows this preface helps students get the most out of the text and its features. It introduces students to key conventions of historical writing and it explains how to read maps, graphs, and tables. A new feature, America's Journey: From Then to Now, relates important issues and events in each chapter to the issues and events of today, letting students see the relevance of history to their lives. Examples include "The American Revolution and the Teaching of American History" (Chapter 6), "From the Eaton Affair to Monicagate" (Chapter 10), "The Confederate Battle Flag" (Chapter 19), and "The Culture Wars" (Chapter 26). An Outline and Key Topics list give students a succinct overview of each chapter. Each chapter begins with an engaging opening story that highlights important themes. The American Views box in each chapter contains a relevant primary source document. Taken from letters, diaries, newspapers, government papers, and other sources, these bring the people of the past and their concerns vividly alive. An introduction and prereading questions relate the documents to the text and direct students' attention to important issues. Overview Tables in each chapter summarize complex issues. Chapter chronologies help students build a framework of key events. Key Terms are highlighted within each chapter and defined in an end-of-book Glossary. Chapter Review Questions help students review the material in a chapter and relate it to broader themes. A list of Key Readings and Additional Sources at the end of each chapter directs interested students to further information about the subject of the chapter. Where To Learn More sections describe important historical sites students can visit to gain a deeper understanding of the events discussed in the chapter. Abundant maps, charts, and graphs help students understand important events and trends. The topographical detail in many of the maps helps students understand the influence of geography on history. Illustrations and photographs&#x2014;tied to the text with detailed captions&#x2014;provide a visual dimension to history.

In the wake of recent Russian expansionism, political risk expert Agnia Grigas illustrates how&#x2014;for more than two decades&#x2014;Moscow has consistently used its compatriots in bordering nations for its territorial ambitions. Demonstrating how this policy has been implemented in Ukraine and Georgia, Grigas provides cutting-edge analysis of the nature of Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s foreign policy and compatriot protection to warn that Moldova, Kazakhstan, the Baltic States, and others are also at risk.</p><p><b>Agnia Grigas</b> is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. She lives in Washington, D.C."Scarcely any aspect of Russian foreign policy has received more attention and less serious exploration than Russia's maneuvering in former parts of the Soviet Union. Grigas takes a sizable step toward rectifying that imbalance by carefully tracing Moscow's approach to so-called compatriots--ethnic Russians, Russian speakers, and those who simply identify with Russia--in these now independent states."

Lincoln on Leadership, by Donald T. Phillips, seemed to be a clever twist on the books I studied as a faculty member at the Academy of Leadership at the University of Maryland. I bought it as a quick, informative read, and I wasn&#x2019;t disappointed. Only later did I find out that the book had launched a small industry of similar titles in the business leadership book genre. <p>As a historian and leadership educator, I thought Phillips did a terrific job of weaving Lincoln stories and quotes around principles of leadership for today&#x2019;s executives. But I wanted something more. My area of expertise is women&#x2019;s leadership, particularly in politics and business. Surely there were some women leaders who could offer leadership wisdom, I thought. So I started searching the book lists. I found Patton on Leadership, Robert E. Lee, Ulysses S. Grant, Jesus, Churchill, Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., Ernest Shackleton, the Founding Fathers, and Ronald Reagan. But the only woman in the group was Elizabeth I. That&#x2019;s how this book was born. </p><p>Eleanor Roosevelt led me to reflect on my leadership, focus on my passion, and get "fired up" about acting on it. I&#x2019;d like to think that, if she were here, she would see this book as an acknowledgment of her leadership, a tribute to her accomplishments, and a heartfelt thank you.</p><p>Robin Gerber, the author of <b>Leadership the Eleanor Roosevelt Way</b>, is an international speaker on leadership, a national commentator, and an opinion writer for <b>USA Today</b> and other major newspapers.

The result is profoundly interesting." -- <em>The</em> <em>New York Review of Books</em></strong></p> <p>As the average age of America&#x2019;s farmers continues to rise, we face serious questions about what farming will look like in the near future, and who will be growing our food. Many younger people are interested in going into agriculture, especially organic farming, but cannot find affordable land, or lack the conceptual framework and practical information they need to succeed in a job that can be both difficult and deeply fulfilling.</p> <p>In <em>Fruitful Labor,</em> Mike Madison meticulously describes the ecology of his own small family farm in the Sacramento Valley of California. He covers issues of crop ecology such as soil fertility, irrigation needs, and species interactions, as well as the broader agroecological issues of the social, economic, regulatory, and technological environments in which the farm operates. The final section includes an extensive analysis of sustainability on every level.</p> <p>Pithy, readable, and highly relevant, this book covers both the ecology and the economy of a truly sustainable agriculture. Although Madison&#x2019;s farm is unique, the broad lessons he has gleaned from his more than three decades as an organic farmer will resonate strongly with the new generation of farmers who work the land, wherever they might live.</p> <p><strong>*This book is part of Chelsea Green&nbsp;Publishing&#x2019;s&nbsp;NEW FARMER LIBRARY series, where we collect innovative ideas, hard-earned wisdom, and practical advice from pioneers of the ecological farming movement&#x2015;for the next generation.&nbsp;The&nbsp;series is a collection of proven techniques and philosophies from experienced voices committed to deep organic, small-scale, regenerative farming. Each book in the series offers the new farmer essential tips, inspiration, and first-hand knowledge of what it takes to grow food close to the land.&nbsp;</strong></p></p><p><p>Mike Madison lives with his wife, Dianne, in Winters, California, where they operate a diverse organic farm, growing olives, apricots, citrus, melons, and a variety of cut flowers. In addition to&nbsp;<em>Fruitful Labor</em>, he is also the author of&nbsp;<em>Blithe Tomato&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Walking the Flatlands.</em></p><p>"A good farming book&#x2015;a book about the work of farming&#x2015;shows a kind of narrative reluctance, an unwillingness to tell stories as if the main thing that matters is the way they end. Think of it as a Jeffersonian indifference to profit or the bottom line&#x2015;a nonnarrative approach. What matters instead is the quality of observation, the details. From these things a sense of character will emerge. This isn&#x2019;t just a conceit on my part. There are good models for this kind of writing.... But perhaps the best example I&#x2019;ve ever found is a new book by Mike Madison called <em>Fruitful Labor: The Ecology, Economy, and Practice of a Family Farm</em>." --<strong>Verlyn Klinkenborg</strong>, <strong><em>The New York Review of Books</em></strong></p><br><br><p><strong><em>Wall Street Journal&#x2015;</em></strong></p> <p>"<em>Fruitful Labor</em>&nbsp;is both an encomium to self-reliance and a testament to the analgesic effects of organized surrender. One chapter beautifully describes self-sharpening shovels as they pass through sandy soil; the next serenely concedes an annual percentage of fig trees to ravenous gophers. Yes, crops must be planted, the seasons attended and money made. But these urgencies are only revealed by reading between the lines. Calm prevails&#x2015;the sort of composure that&#x2019;s cultivated through a lifetime devoted to a greater cause.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Fruitful Labor </em>is a delightful book, full of practical advice and deep thinking about ecology and true sustainability. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in food and farming, but especially for young farmers looking to build their skills while gaining wisdom from someone experienced and respected in the field.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Ben Hartman, author of <em>The Lean Farm</em> and <em>The Lean Farm Guide to Growing Vegetables</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Mike Madison offers new and aspiring farmers a book outside the usual vein of small farm narratives and how-to tomes. Discontented with both formulaic prescriptions for the idealized family farm and mega-data studies that sacrifice particularities for trends, Madison instead digs deep into the three decades of farming history on the California plot where he and his wife raise more than 200 plant varieties, ranging from vegetables to flowers to olives&#x2015;and no sacred cows. Madison puts nothing other than nature itself on a pedestal, and he questions his every decision by way of an ecological mirror that reflects back on him without embellishment or distortion.</p> <p>&#x201c;He confesses that he is not enamored with the current celebrations of mission statements, goals, and strategies. Rather, he describes the evolution of his family farm as a timeline without a road map&#x2015;decision points on a long chronology, all informed by unhurried observation. His story is one of searching out hard-won possibilities through perseverance more than strategy.</p> <p>&#x201c;New farmers would be wise to take a day and travel with Madison through the course of his thirty-plus years, learning what lenses to use in examining each ecological, economic, and community-minded decision that all farmers face.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Philip Ackerman-Leist, professor of sustainable agriculture and food systems, Green Mountain College, and author of <em>A Precautionary Tale</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Mike Madison writes from a place of knowing that one acquires only through lived experience. The deep ecology he prescribes, which &#x2018;advocates the rights and values of all species regardless of their utility to human enterprises,&#x2019; should be the central principle of food and farming systems. Akin to the creature in the crystal river in Richard Bach&#x2019;s book <em>Illusions,</em> Mike stopped clinging a long time ago and let the current take him to a higher plane of thought and deed. Proof of this is sprinkled throughout <em>Fruitful Labor</em>.</p> <p>&#x201c;This book is a must-read for those embarking on their journey into farming and for all others who are remotely connected to food and farming, which is all of us.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Sridharan (Sri) Sethuratnam, director, California Farm Academy&nbsp;</strong></p></p><h2>Fundamentals of Hydraulic Engineering Systems</h2><p>Fundamentals of Hydraulic Engineering Systems, Fourth Edition is a very useful reference for practicing engineers who want to review basic principles and their applications in hydraulic engineering systems.

One of the most famous scientists in the world during the middle of the twentieth century, Brown who lived fast, dressed to the nines, gambled, drank, smoked, and was known as a ladies&#x2019; man became as legendary as the dinosaurs he uncovered. <i>Barnum Brown </i>brushes off the loose sediment to reveal the man behind the legend. Drawing on Brown&#x2019;s field correspondence and unpublished notes, and on the writings of his daughter and his two wives, it discloses for the first time details about his life and travels from his youth on the western frontier to his spying for the U.S. government under cover of his expeditions. This absorbing biography also takes full measure of Brown&#x2019;s extensive scientific accomplishments, making it the definitive account of the life and times of a singular man and a superlative fossil hunter.</p><p>"Lowell Dingus and Mark Norell have produced a highly readable, comprehensive account of the life and scientific work of Barnum Brown, arguably the most intrepid and successful collector of dinosaurs and other prehistoric vertebrates ever.

Pre-order now to complete your collection in time for Roald Dahl Day, September 2017. Billy&#39;s mum says he must never go out through the garden gate and explore the dark forest beyond. So, one day, that&#39;s exactly what he does! There he meets the Minpins, tiny tree-dwelling people whose children are the size of matchsticks. They live in fear of the terrible, galloping GRUNCHER. Will it gobble Billy too - or can he find a way to defeat the hungry beast? From Matilda to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The BFG, the collaboration between Roald Dahl and Quentin Blake has captured millions of children&#39;s imaginations for nearly forty years. Billy and the Minpins, this new interpretation of Roald Dahl&#39;s very last story (originally published in 1991), is just as magical.</p><p>Someday someone will write a book that begins with a mother forbidding her child to enter the deep dark woods and ends with that child achieving incredible success without ever setting a toe in the forbidden forest. But not this book. Here, Billy's mom issues a few scary warnings about the woods to her son--"Beware! Beware! The Forest of Sin! None come out, but many go in!"--turns her back for a second, and the next thing you know the devil shows up and whispers something to Bobby about wild strawberries. Blammo! Guess where Billy goes--straight to the forbidden forest, of course. At this point, if you are reading the story aloud to your child, you may think there's a parable on the way. But just when you might expect to run into monsters named Lust, Avarice, and Three-Toed Sloth (okay, maybe not Lust), a real monster comes careening along and you realize that this story is just a fairy tale after all--and quite a lovely one at that.<p> <i>The Minpins</i> taps into the powerful, wonderful child's fantasy of discovering a hidden civilization of tiny folk that accepts and honors him or her. The very best part of this fairy tale is the denouement, where Billy receives the gift of nightly escape on the wings of a swan. One of Roald Dahl's only picture books--with fabulously crosshatched pen-and-ink illustrations by Patrick Benson--<i>The Minpins</i> is superb for reading aloud to the three- to eight-year-old set. And it culminates in a sentence or two of advice that your children just might remember for the rest of their lives. <i>(Ages 3 to 8)</i></p>Roald Dahl was a spy, ace fighter pilot, chocolate historian and medical inventor.

Over the past decade, a growing consensus in Europe has voiced similar decrees. But what do these ominous proclamations, from across the political spectrum, mean? From the influx of immigrants in the 1950s to contemporary worries about refugees and terrorism<i>, The Crisis of Multiculturalism in Europe</i> examines the historical development of multiculturalism on the Continent. Rita Chin argues that there were few efforts to institute state-sponsored policies of multiculturalism, and those that emerged were pronounced failures virtually from their inception. She shows that today's crisis of support for cultural pluralism isn't new but actually has its roots in the 1980s.</p><p>Chin looks at the touchstones of European multiculturalism, from the urgent need for laborers after World War II to the public furor over the publication of <i>The Satanic Verses</i> and the question of French girls wearing headscarves to school. While many Muslim immigrants had lived in Europe for decades, in the 1980s they came to be defined by their religion and the public's preoccupation with gender relations. Acceptance of sexual equality became the critical gauge of Muslims' compatibility with Western values. The convergence of left and right around the defense of such personal freedoms against a putatively illiberal Islam has threatened to undermine commitment to pluralism as a core ideal. Chin contends that renouncing the principles of diversity brings social costs, particularly for the left, and she considers how Europe might construct an effective political engagement with its varied population.</p><p>Challenging the mounting opposition to a diverse society, <i>The Crisis of Multiculturalism in Europe</i> presents a historical investigation into one continent's troubled relationship with cultural difference.</p></p><p><p>"Rita Chin's indispensable and timely book brilliantly analyzes the ideological obfuscation involved in the claim by Western Europeans, on the right and left, that &#x2018;multiculturalism' has failed. Instead, Chin suggests, it was never really tried. Exploring the roots of past racism and its new secularist forms today, Chin casts a sobering and troubling look at the intolerance of difference in Europe."<b>--Samuel Moyn, author of <i>Christian Human Rights</i></b></p><p>"A clear, incisive account of the trajectories of multiculturalism in Western Europe, Rita Chin's book is one that many of us will want to have close at hand. This is a must-read for all who are concerned with the fate of diversity in today&#x2019;s Europe."<b>--John R. Bowen, author of <i>On British Islam</i></b></p><p>"The question of whether European societies can and should be multicultural has come to the fore in an era when the political cleavage of Left vs. Right is increasingly giving way to Open vs. Closed. Rita Chin tackles this pressing issue adroitly and comprehensively by offering a comparative analysis of several decades of debates over multiculturalism in Europe. This book is an urgent must-read for scholars and policymakers alike."<b>--Sophie Meunier Aitsahalia, Princeton University</b></p><p>"There are several other books about multiculturalism in modern Europe, but none to my knowledge bring to bear the same level of historical depth and systematic comparative analysis found in Chin's excellent work. This is not only a key text in the history of multiculturalism in contemporary Europe, but it adds a new dimension to the broader history of Europe since 1945. A pleasure to read."<b>--Tyler Stovall, University of California, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>"This book offers much to admire. It provides extensive coverage of a timely, important topic, and the comparative approach is original."<b>--Jordanna Bailkin, University of Washington</b></p><b>Rita Chin</b> is associate professor of history at the University of Michigan.

Initial chapters review the diversity and basic biology of the different groups of marine parasites worldwide and provides illustrations of the various groups. For each group the book discusses details of morphology, life cycles, infection mechanisms, and effects on hosts. Later chapters cover the ecology and importance of marine parasites. Topics discussed include the behavioral aspects of parasitism, ecology, evolution and zoogeography as well as the economic, environmental and medical importance of marine parasites. The book gives readers a general background to each topic, along with up-to-date reviews of novel concepts and cutting-edge research.</p><p>Klaus Rohde"Readers who know other books covering similar field will be amazed to find here, in addition to 'classical' protistan, helminth and crustacean parasites and chapters on general problems, a huge realm of alien creatures not to be encountered in other parasitological compendia." (<i>Folia Parasitologica</i>)</p><h2>Psychoanalytic Criticism (New Accents)</h2><p>This book examines the relationship of psychoanalytic theory to the theories of literature and the arts.</p><p>What is psychoanalytic criticism and how can it be justified as a type of criticism in its own right? In this new and thoroughly revised edition of her classic textbook, Elizabeth Wright provides a cogent answer to this question and a wide-ranging introduction to psychoanalytic criticism from Freud to the present day. <p><br>Since each school of psychoanalysis has its own theory of the aesthetic process, the field is complex. Adopting a critical perspective, Elizabeth Wright focuses on major figures and texts in psychoanalysis and in literary and art criticism: classical psychoanalysis; Jungian analytic psychology; objects-relations theory; French psychoanalysis; French anti-psychoanalysis; feminist psychoanalytic criticism. Across these divisions certain problems recur, problems which conceal themselves in a wide range of surprising places, from Shakespearean tragedy to performance theatre from magic realism to detective fiction, from the German <i>Lied </i>to Wagner. These areas are investigated with reference to rival psychoanalytic theories, while connections are traced between the aesthetic process and the psychoanalytic approach. </p> <p><br>Already established as the leading introduction to the field, this new edition of <i>Psychoanalytic Criticism </i>will be essential reading for students of literature and literary theory, psychoanalysis, feminism and feminist theory, cultural studies and the humanities generally.</p><b>Elizabeth Wright</b>, University of Cambridge</p><h2>A Mathematical Introduction to Fluid Mechanics (Texts in Applied Mathematics, 4)</h2><p>A presentation of some of the basic ideas of fluid mechanics in a mathematically attractive manner.

One of the guests tells about a governess at a country house plagued by supernatural visitors. But in the hands of Henry James, the master of nuance, this little tale of terror is an exquisite gem of sexual and psychological ambiguity. Only the young governess can see the ghosts; only she suspects that the previous governess and her lover are controlling the two orphaned children (a girl and a boy) for some evil purpose. The household staff don't know what she's talking about, the children are evasive when questioned, and the master of the house (the children's uncle) is absent. Why does the young girl claim not to see a perfectly visible woman standing on the far side of the lake? Are the children being deceptive, or is the governess being paranoid? By leaving the questions unanswered, <i>The Turn of Screw</i> generates spine-tingling anxiety in its mesmerized readers.Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Cognitive Science draws upon many academic disciplines, including Psychology, Computer Science, Philosophy, Linguistics and Neuroscience. This is the first textbook to present a unified view of Cognitive Science as a discipline in its own right, with a distinctive approach to studying the mind. Students are introduced to the cognitive scientist's 'toolkit' - the vast range of techniques and tools that cognitive scientists can use to study the mind. The book presents the main theoretical models that cognitive scientists are currently using, and shows how those models are being applied to unlock the mysteries of the human mind. Cognitive Science is replete with examples, illustrations, and applications, and draws on cutting-edge research and new developments to explore both the achievements that cognitive scientists have made, and the challenges that lie ahead. <p></p></p><p>Cognitive science is at last treated as a unified subject in this exciting textbook.

Jung the chief prefiguration of his analytical psychology. Jung did not simply interpret Gnostic texts psychologically but also cited them as confirmation of his psychology. An authority on theories of myth and Gnosticism, Robert Segal has searched the Jungian corpus to bring together in one volume Jung's main discussions of this ancient form of spirituality. Included in this volume are both Jung's sole work devoted entirely to Gnosticism, "Gnostic Symbols of the Self," and his own Gnostic myth, "Seven Sermons to the Dead." The book also contains key essays by two of the best-known writers on Jungian psychology and Gnosticism: Father Victor White and Gilles Quispel, whose "C. G. Jung und die Gnosis" is here translated for the first time. In his extensive introduction Segal discusses Jung's fascination with Gnosticism, the parallel for Jung between ancient Gnostics and modern Jungian patients, the Jungian meaning of Gnostic myths and of the Seven Sermons, Jung's possible misinterpretation of Gnosticism, and the common characterization of Jung himself as a contemporary Gnostic.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Women&#39;s Life in Greece and Rome: A Source Book in Translation</h2><p><p>Now in its fourth edition, this highly acclaimed sourcebook examines the public and private lives and legal status of Greek and Roman women.

King and Leslie S. Klinger present a brand-new anthology of stories inspired by the Arthur Conan Doyle canon.</strong></p> In this follow-up to the acclaimed <em>In the Company of Sherlock Holmes</em>, expert Sherlockians Laurie King and Les Klinger put forth the question: What happens when great writers/creators who are not known as Sherlock Holmes devotees admit to being inspired by Conan Doyle stories? While some are highly-regarded mystery writers, others are best known for their work in the fields of fantasy or science fiction. All of these talented authors, however, share a great admiration for Arthur Conan Doyle and his greatest creations, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.<br><br> To the editors&#x2019; great delight, these stories go in many directions. Some explore the spirit of Holmes himself; others tell of detectives themselves inspired by Holmes&#x2019;s adventures or methods. A young boy becomes a detective; a young woman sharpens her investigative skills; an aging actress and a housemaid each find that they have unexpected talents. Other characters from the Holmes stories are explored, and even non-Holmesian tales by Conan Doyle are echoed. The variations are endless!<br><br> Although not a formal collection of new Sherlock Holmes stories&#x2015;however some do fit that mold&#x2015;instead these writers were asked to be inspired by the Conan Doyle canon. The results are breathtaking, for fans of Holmes and Watson as well as readers new to Doyle&#x2019;s writing&#x2015;indeed, for all readers who love exceptional storytelling.</p><p><p><strong>Laurie R.

Yet very little of Picabia's poetry and prose has been translated into English, and his literary experiments have never been the subject of close critical study.<i> I Am a Beautiful Monster</i> is the first definitive edition in English of Picabia's writings, gathering a sizable array of Picabia's poetry and prose and, most importantly, providing a critical context for it with an extensive introduction and detailed notes by the translator.</p><p>Picabia's poetry and prose is belligerent, abstract, polemical, radical, and sometimes simply baffling. For too long, Picabia's writings have been presented as raw events, rule-breaking manifestations of inspirational <i>carpe diem</i>.

Sometimes described in considerable detail, the creatures are reported as still living or as having survived until recent times. The aim of the book is to discover the source of these representations and their status in local systems of knowledge, partly in relation to distinct categories of spiritual beings, known animals, and other human groups. It explores images of the wildman from throughout Southeast Asia, focusing in particular on the Indonesian islands, and beyond, including the Asian mainland, Africa, North America, Africa, Australia, and Oceania.</p> <p>The book reveals how, in Southeast Asia and elsewhere, &#x2018;wildmen&#x2019; cannot readily be explained as imaginary constructs rooted in cultural values and social institutions, nor as simply another kind of &#x2018;spirit&#x2019;. Also critically examined is a view of such figures as fundamentally similar expressions of a pan-human mental &#x2018;archetype&#x2019;. Forth concludes that many Asian and African figures are grounded in experience or memories of anthropoid apes supplemented by encounters with ethnic others. Representations developed among European immigrants (including the North American &#x2018;sasquatch&#x2019;) are, in part, similarly traceable to an indirect knowledge of primates, informed by long-standing European representations of hairy humans that have coloured western views of non-western peoples and which may themselves originate in ancient experience of apes. At the same time, the book demonstrates how Indonesian and other Malayo-Polynesian images cannot be explained in the same way, and explores the possibility of these reflecting an ancient experience of non-sapiens hominins.</p></p><p><p><strong>Gregory Forth</strong> is a Professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Alberta, Canada.</p> <p>Research Excellence Award (Full Professor) for 2008-09, Faculty of Arts, University of Alberta - 2009</p><p><strong>"In Forth&#x2019;s conclusions to this well-written, solid, groundbreaking exercise in ethnozooology and comparative epistemology two remarkable things stand out.

These women have created absurdist and black-humor storytelling practices in the face of trauma and tragedy. Goldstein helps us to understand that such joking and laughter is part of an emotional aesthetic that defines the sense of frustration and anomie endemic to the political and economic desperation of the shantytown.</p><p>"Goldstein returns anthropology to what it does best while taking the reader on a no-holds-barred ride through the tragicomic world of a Rio favela.

Rather than simply emphasizing the calculation step, the authors first ensure that students learn how to identify problems, construct or select models, and figure out what data needs to be collected.

(Historians at Work)</h2><p>What caused the Pueblo revolt of 1680? This now-famous revolt marked the end of 80 years of peaceful coexistence between Spaniards and Pueblos; historians have long struggled to understand the complex reasons for the sudden and dramatic breakdown of relations. In this volume, 5 historians examine the factors that led to the unprecedented collaboration among tribes separated by distance, language, and historic rivalries that resulted in the destruction of Spain&#39;s New Mexico colony. Searching through what little remains of the written record, the essays present a variety of interpretations, with different emphases on culture, religion, and race.</p><p><b>DAVID J.

Since 1598, when Juan de O�ate brought a small group of colonists into the mesa and canyon country of northern New Mexico, Spain had asserted its sovereignty over the Pueblo peoples. Spanish officials had demanded that Pueblos pay tribute to the Spanish Crown by working for encomenderos, a small number of privileged Spaniards to whom Spanish officials entrusted the Pueblos and their labor. At the same time, Spanish priests established missions in the Pueblos' farming villages and demanded that the Indians abandon their religion in favor of Christianity. Pueblo Indians, who vastly outnumbered their Spanish overlords, tolerated this arrangement for several generations. <br><br><i>On Pueblo culture and Christianity . . .</i> <br>The Pueblos, whose own cultural tradition went back at least to the time that Europeans believed the son of their god, Jesus Christ, walked on the earth, seemed ideal subjects for conversion. Like the Iberians, the Pueblos lived in towns, farmed nearby fields, and wore what Spaniards recognized as clothing. Although they were not a homogeneous people and spoke several discrete languages, Spaniards named these Indians "Pueblos" because they lived in permanent towns (pueblos) of stone or adobe, in contrast to the nomads and seminomads whose lands Spaniards traversed to reach New Mexico. For Franciscans, who insisted that Indians lived like Spaniards and tried to congregate them into towns if they did not, the apartment-dwelling Pueblos seemed a godsend. Although Franciscans failed to plant missions among Apaches, Navajos, and other seminomads who surrounded the Pueblo country, they succeeded among the Pueblos. <br><br><i>On Spanish brutality . . .</i> <br>Until 1680, Pueblos tolerated the outsiders. An agricultural people, rooted to fertile valleys in a high desert land of little rain, Pueblos had no other place to go. Some tried to rebel, but revolts remained isolated affairs easily quashed by Spaniards. The autonomous Pueblo towns, separated by several hundred miles and at least six different languages and countless dialects, had no central government to unify them. Moreover, Pueblos knew that rebellion invited hideous retaliations. How could Pueblos forget the burning of the Pueblo of �coma when it offered resistance in 1598 and the punishments meted out to the survivors by Spaniards with swords of steel? Treating Indian miscreants as brutally as they treated one another, Spaniards cut the right foot off every male �coman over twenty-five years of age. <br><br><i>On the events of the Pueblo Revolt . . .</i> <br>Then, in a few weeks in the late summer of 1680, Pueblos destroyed the Spanish colony of New Mexico. Coordinating their efforts as they had never done before, Pueblos launched a well-planned surprise attack. From the kiva at Taos, Pueblo messengers secretly carried calendars in the form of knotted cords to participating pueblos. Each knot marked a day until the Pueblos would take up arms. The last knot was to be united on August 11, but the rebellion exploded a day early. Tipped off by sympathetic Pueblos, Spaniards had captured two of the rebel messengers on August 9. When leaders of the revolt learned that they had been betrayed, they moved the attack up a day. Despite the warning, the revolt caught Spaniards off guard. They could not imagine the magnitude of the planned assault. Scattered in isolated farms and ranches along the Rio Grande and its tributaries, Spaniards were easy prey for the rebels�.Governor Oterm�n estimated that the Pueblos had killed more than four hundred of New Mexico's Hispanic residents, whose total numbers did not exceed three thousand. The rebels desecrated the churches and killed twenty-one of the province's thirty-three Franciscans, in many cases humiliating, tormenting, and beating them before taking their lives. <br><br><i>On historians and the Pueblo Revolt . . .</i> <br>Although scholars of American history have slighted Pueblos and Spaniards, historians who study southwestern America or Latin America have long regarded the Pueblo Revolt as an important event: one of the most successful uprisings against Europeans in the New World. The Pueblo Revolt pales next to the more enduring victory of the Araucanians, who maintained autonomy for two centuries after destroying seven substantial Spanish towns in south-central Chile in 1598-1603, but the Pueblos' achievement was significant and unusual. It marked one of the rare moments in more than three hundred years of colonial rule in the Americas that Spaniards suffered a thorough defeat by natives whom they had long subjected. Moreover, most scholars believe that the Pueblos' act of defiance assured them of a measure of freedom from future Spanish efforts to eradicate their culture.</p><h2>Nuggets: New and Old Writing on Art, Architecture, and Culture (Positions)</h2><p>Dan Graham (born 1942) began his career directing the John Daniels Gallery in New York City in 1964, where he mounted Sol LeWitt&#x2019;s first one-man show. His acclaimed group shows included works by artists such as Donald Judd, Dan Flavin and Robert Smithson. Like them, Graham considered himself a writer&#x2013;artist, publishing essays and reviews on topics ranging from rock music to Eisenhower&#x2019;s paintings and Dean Martin&#x2019;s television show. His earliest projects dealt with the magazine page, and one of his seminal early works was a series of magazine-style photographs with text, &#x201c;Homes for America&#x201d; (1966&#x2013;1967). Today he is among America&#x2019;s most prominent artists, both as a practitioner and as a well-respected critic and theorist. This important and substantial collection brings together an assortment of texts both old and new, with writings on art, artists&#x2019; books, architecture and various artists Graham admires, such as Carl Andre, Sol LeWitt, Claes Oldenburg, Jeff Wall and John Chamberlain. Also included is a selection of interviews conducted since the 1990s, most notably on his large-scale installations and pavilions incorporating mirrors--a culmination of his long examination of the psychological relationship between people and architecture.

He and his wife live in Del Mar, California.With the present revival of interest in Yiddish, this light, popular introduction will appeal to newcomers to the language and also to those who remember bits and pieces and want to know more. The authors don't try for the comprehensiveness of Leo Rosten's <i>Joys of Yiddish </i>(1968). Rather, they focus on the heart of the language, how it expresses European Jewish history and culture, and what Yiddish has lent and borrowed in America. Clearly designed for browsing, with lots of subheads and boxed notes, and with the Yiddish words in bold type, there are chapters on humor, on proverbs and sayings, and on recipes and cooking. There's also a useful overview of literature, theater, and music, past and present. A long alphabetical list of expressions works great for quick reference, and the final extensive bibliography includes Web sites. This is a book for sharing and reading aloud: the schmaltzy endearments, the grousing and <i>kvetching</i>, and, of course, the insults-- untranslatable, irreplaceable in their invective and vulgarity, hilarious "if they're not directed at you." <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

When, years later in the 1980s, Flor is murdered in Guatemala while running an orphanage, Roger returns to uncover the truth of her death. There he is reunited with Luis Moya, a childhood friend, and together they attempt to chronicle Flor&#39;s life story, a quest that will have unexpected, and unforgettable repercussions.</p><p>FRANCISCO GOLDMAN is the author of three novels: <i>The Long Night of White Chickens</i>, which won the Sue Kaufman Prize for First Fiction and was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award; <i>The Ordinary Seaman</i>, a finalist for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award and The Los Angeles Times Book Prize; and <i>The Divine Husband</i>. Goldman is also the author of the non-fiction book, <i>The Art of Political Murder: Who killed the Bishop?</i>, which was named a Best Book of the Year by <i>The Chicago Tribune</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i>, and <i>The Economist</i>. Goldman has been a contributing editor for Harper&#x2019;s magazine, and his fiction, journalism and essays have appeared in publications such as <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, <i>Esquire</i> and <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>.

Fyvel Freedom of Expression Book Award, and was a fellow at the American Academy of Berlin and the Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library. He currently directs the Premio Aura Estrada/Aura Estrada Prize (www.premioauraestrada.com). Goldman divides his time between Brooklyn and Mexico City.It is a wonderful book . . . this remembrance of the Massachusetts life and Guatemalan death of Flor de Mayo Puac, sometime maid and confidante and older-sister to Roger Graetz . . . . Complex as history, funny as love, painful as death. The mystery of Goldman&#x2019;s Guatemala is the mystery of anyone&#x2019;s family, anyone&#x2019;s friendships and obsessions.&#x201d; <i>The Washington Post Book World<br></i><br> It takes one&#x2019;s breath away. . . . Goldman pulls together the threads of the story brilliantly, moving back and forth in time like a nimble Mayan weaver creating an elaborate huipil.&#x201d; <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i><br><br> Francisco Goldman, in this fine first novel, delivers a complete world, sensual, tender and painful in its friendships, and expansive in its memory. . . . With a wealth of startling detail, he gives us a world that feels as if it could almost be touched.&#x201d; <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br> Francisco Goldman&#x2019;s beautiful first novel is at once a story about a boy growing up in two cultures, a love story, and a mystery about an unsolved murder. It is meditation, investigation and chronicle written in lyrical, evocative English . . . . Flor is a compelling and enigmatic personality."<i> Boston Globe</i><br><br> <i>The Long Night of White Chickens</i> is one of the most extraordinary first works to be published in decades. Not since Nabokov&#x2019;s infamous <i>Lolita</i> or Toni Morrison&#x2019;s <i>Song of Solomon</i> has an author displayed such mastery of contemporary literary method.&#x201d; <i>The San Francisco Review of Books</i><br><br> A tale that sensitively depicts the very best of human dignity and love. . . .

It is an insistent story, filled with characters who keep whispering to us long after we&#x2019;ve put the book down. . . . A book about the many faces of truth, full of love and humor. . . . Playing with time and reality and the idea that beauty and evil are inextricably linked could be dangerous for a first novelist, but Goldman pulls it off.&#x201d; <i>The New York Observer</i><br><br> Francisco Goldman has synthesized the literary traditions of two continents in one of the most ambitious literary debuts in years. Funny and sad, wise and wide-eyed, <i>Chickens</i> is a richly layered, genre-busting novel that shuttles between suburban Boston and Guatemala City and devours everything in its path.&#x201d; Jay McInerney<br><br> Francisco Goldman has produced a remarkable first novel. . .a beautifully balanced mix of intensity and grace, intelligence and imagination. I admired all kinds of things about his book, not least of which was that it told a terrific story, never didactic, always rich in incident and human drama.<i> The Long Night of White Chickens</i> deserves a wide readership, lots of prizes.&#x201d;�� Tim O&#x2019;Brien<br><br> <i>The Long Night of White Chickens </i>is essentially a love story, the story of two men whose love for Flor de Mayo haunts them long after she is murdered. It asks us to question the conditions of love we have created in our time, and the bittersweet love relationship between the United States and Latin America. Oye, vos, you have brought a beautiful and complex woman to life. She is as magical as the realism you evoke in the writing. It is the story of all our mothers, wives, daughters, lovers. It is the story of the Americas.&#x201d; From the PEN/Faulkner Award citation by Rudolfo Anaya<br><br> What Francisco Goldman has created is a masterpiece. . . . Combining American optimism, Latin illusion and Russian angst, his remarkable first novel magically explores life, love, death, politics, intrigue and obsession in a bicultural plot twisting from here to Guatemala. . . . Infinitely satisfying.&#x201d; <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i><br><br> Here is a first novel displaying a robust brilliance. . . . A splendid and riveting book . . . humorous, anecdotal, perceptive, beautifully written, and infected with an intense sense of joie de vivre. . . . [Goldman] approaches Central America . . . as a knowledgeable insider in both societies. He is very Yankee, very Guatemalan: the history of intervention and the story of personal identity are inextricably entwined.&#x201d; <i>The Guardian</i> (UK)<br><br> <i>The Long Night of White Chickens</i> is a wonderful book of leaps: leaps through cultures, with a thousand humorous or profound insights about Gringos and Latins&#x2019;; . . . leaps between horror and beauty; and leaps between observation and imagination. An enormous and pleasurable surprise.&#x201d; Elena Castedo<br><br> Telling the punchline first takes guts and style both of which Francisco Goldman has aplenty. Flor, a woman who is dead when the novel opens, comes brilliantly alive as Roger chases her life through Boston snowstorms, cheap whorehouses on the outskirts of Guatemala City and highland villages of the repressed Maya.&#x201d; <i>The Boston Phoenix</i><br><br> Eloquent and powerful. . . . A compelling love story and an intriguing mystery . . . A masterfully conceived work of art. . . . Lyrical, at times comic, a prose that faithfully captures the speech patterns of Central America. . . . Dramatic tension melds with rich descriptions of Guatemala City life: A wealthy Parisian family that five years after adopting an Indian orphan are told her parents have reappeared. A Colombian couple whose sexual excitement on their wedding night ends in an absurdly comic death. . . . And the Fo Lu Shu, where Flor and Luis Moya fall in love during a long tropical night.&#x201d; <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i><br><br> Seamlessly melds private and public, introspection and action. . . . A complex, riveting novel. . . . The narratives of Roger and Moya the former related in first person and the latter in third expand the reader&#x2019;s knowledge through an enriching counterpoint.&#x201d; <i>The Miami Herald<br></i><br> A beautiful story of national identity and love. . . . Roger might be either the native son in search of his roots, or Holden Caulfield on a brief trip to hell. . . . With Garc�a M�rquez, Goldman shares a love of narrative abundance, a profusion of character and detail that accrues to a rich whole. . . . Illuminated by innumerable small moments of humor, beauty and power.&#x201d; <i>The Bookpress<br></i><br> A splendid first novel. . . . Fashions a surfeit of intelligent detail about its protagonist&#x2019;s two countries into a fascinating study of cultural contrasts.&#x201d; <i>USA Today</i><br><br> The novel, like Roger himself, stands between two worlds in part a personal story of love and coming of age, it is also a grand historical assault in the tradition of Joseph Conrad and Graham Greene.&#x201d; <i>Vanity Fair</i><br><br> An enthralling first novel. . . . Passionate, romantic and grimly witty . . . Subtle and tender.&#x201d; <i>The Evening Standard</i> (UK)<br><br> Dazzling. . . . Blending Yankee can-do intellectualism with Latin myth-making.&#x201d; <i>The Plain Dealer</i> (Cleveland)<br><br> This striking debut novel begins as a coming-of-age story and ends as much more. Part nontraditional love story, part mystery, this book is also an examination of politics social, sexual and emotional . . . acidly observant . . . Roger&#x2019;s emotional journey is a long one <i>Chickens </i>is clearly rich enough to be savored for a similarly long time.&#x201d; <i>People</i><br><br> Fiercely realized. . . . This large, bursting book, with its elastic brilliance and geographical roaming, is a generous riposte to segregationist meanness.&#x2019;. . . A good part of the novel deals with the exhilarating strangeness of growing up in the U.S. with a Jewish father and a Guatemalan mother. . . . When Goldman writes directly of Guatemala . . . the prose rushes along with the pleasure of discovery, and dense description is used for its primary work: enchantment.&#x201d; <i>Vogue</i> (UK)<br><br> Leaves the reader pondering the complications of vulnerable hearts and ravenous desires.&#x201d; <i>Minneapolis Post-Bulletin</i><br><br> <i>The Long Night of White Chickens</i> is an exceptional novel which gently forces us to acknowledge and truly listen to voices from beyond our borders which have been hidden for too long.&#x201d; Ariel Dorfman<br><br> Extraordinary. . . . A consummate story teller . . . The novel&#x2019;s triumph is Flor, a heroine as complex and fragile as the society she inhabits.&#x201d; <i>The Boston Review</i><br><br> A remarkable novel. . . . Accruing vivid new details at every turn, Roger&#x2019;s account gives the reader the most immediate possible sense of a country and its people, the comic and appealing as well as the horrific.&#x201d; <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br> Goldman&#x2019;s complex and masterful tale loops and turns and doubles back on itself, revealing the transmutability of truth, the narcosis of obsession, the enigmas of culture, and the irrepressible drive to survive.&#x201d; <i>Booklist</i><br><br> A novel that is about love and self-discovery, obsession and the persistence of memory. . . . Goldman is so skillful that he is able to digress for many pages and not lose either the reader or the novel&#x2019;s direction. . . . Flor [is] a charmingly eccentric character who leaps at us from the pages.&#x201d; <i>Newsday</i><br><br> Hardly a standard fictional debut . . . Goldman has written a murder mystery that is also a psychological puzzle, political thriller, boy&#x2019;s own adventure, family drama and multicult comedy. It&#x2019;s a love story several love stories, actually and off-kilter history of Central America in the 80s, a story of obsession and repression. . . . The plot flashes back, forward, sideways: Frank Goldman sneaks up on you, obliquely, the way childhood memories sometimes do.&#x201d; <i>The Village Voice</i><br><br> A triumph of tale-spinning.&#x201d; <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i><br><br> A tour de force. . . . A wonderful novelist.&#x201d; <i>The Wichita Eagle</i><br><br> Impressive. . . . Goldman has a particular gift for catching the truth of some emotionally taut moment and twisting it into an unexpected image. . . . Sexual politics are very much the strong suit of this politically charged novel. . . . A remarkable debut altogether.&#x201d; <i>The London Review of Books</i><br><br> To be in love with a book is to exhibit all the classic symptoms of romantic obsession. Once you&#x2019;ve begun, you can&#x2019;t stop. You want to read it all the time, be with it, in it. . . . All of which is to say, I love you, <i>The Long Night of White Chickens</i>. . . . A story of unfulfilled and obsessive love, though it is as much a political novel and an exploration of the way we create our personal histories as a love story.&#x201d; <i>The Austin Chronicle<br></i><br> Myth intermingles with reality as Goldman guides us through his haunting first novel, a family love story. . . . A tapestry of understanding.&#x201d; <i>The Seattle Times</i></p><h2>Better Safe than Sued: Keeping Your Students and Ministry Alive</h2><p><p>Most youth workers will admit that they don&#x2019;t spend a lot of time thinking about safety in their youth ministry. Sure, they shout, &#x201c;Seat belts!&#x201d; when the crew loads into the van, or they use the buddy system when at theme parks. But beyond that, they&#x2019;re mostly concerned with introducing students to Jesus. Nothing&#x2019;s wrong with looking after their spiritual well-being, but overlooking their safety can lead to pain and problems for you, your students, your church, or your community. The reality is, whether it&#x2019;s a game of dodgeball in the church gym, or a rock climbing trip during a summer retreat, you have precious cargo in your care, and it&#x2019;s your responsibility to make sure they return home safely and in one piece. Better Safe Than Sued is an essential guidebook for anyone in youth ministry&#x2014;paid or volunteer, veteran or rookie. Along with questions to get you thinking about your own ministry context after each chapter, inside you&#x2019;ll discover how you can make your ministry a safe place for students and leaders as you read about: � Safety while riding in buses, vans, and cars � Camps, retreats, and conferences � Selecting staff � Avoiding sexual misconduct � Establishing a No-Bully Zone � How to handle injuries, and much more Make sure your ministry is safe and that you&#x2019;re protected so you never have to be the one saying, &#x201c;I never took safety seriously until ...&#x201d;</p></p><p>For more than 35 years, Jack Crabtree has been working with young people and youth leaders on Long Island with Youth for Christ.

Qigong served a critical social organizational function, as practitioners formed new informal networks, sometimes on an international scale, at a time when China was shifting from state-subsidized medical care to for-profit market medicine. The emergence of new psychological states deemed to be deviant led the Chinese state to &#34;medicalize&#34; certain forms while championing scientific versions of qigong. By contrast, qigong continues to be promoted outside China as a traditional healing practice. Breathing Spaces brings to life the narratives of numerous practitioners, healers, psychiatric patients, doctors, and bureaucrats, revealing the varied and often dramatic ways they cope with market reform and social changes in China.</p><p>The charismatic form of healing called qigong, which at its core involves meditative breathing exercises, achieved enormous popularity in China during the last two decades.

Rollins and his students developed a way of working that combined art-making with reading literature and writing personal narratives: Rollins or a student would read aloud from classic literary texts by such authors as Shakespeare and Orwell while the rest of the class drew or wrote on the pages being read, connecting the stories to their own experiences. Often, Rollins and his students (who later named themselves &#x201c;Kids of Survival&#x201d; or K.O.S.) cut out book pages and laid them on a grid on canvas before undertaking their graphic interventions. This process developed into the group's signature style, which they applied to literary texts, musical scores, and other printed matter. This book and the accompanying major museum retrospective document the history of the groundbreaking practice of Tim Rollins and K.O.S., with full color images of paintings, drawings, sculptures, and prints. These include a caricature of Jesse Helms with an animal body drawn on the pages of Animal Farm; graffiti-like images painted in acrylic on the pages of Frankenstein; a gleaming pattern of fantastical golden horns on Kafka's Amerika; and a series of red letter A's on The Scarlet Letter.

Perhaps best known for his critique of rational choice theory, Shapiro expands his purview here. In discipline after discipline, he argues, scholars have fallen prey to inward-looking myopia that results from--and perpetuates--a flight from reality.</p><br><p> In the method-driven academic culture we inhabit, argues Shapiro, researchers too often make display and refinement of their techniques the principal scholarly activity. The result is that they lose sight of the objects of their study. Pet theories and methodological blinders lead unwelcome facts to be ignored, sometimes not even perceived. The targets of Shapiro's critique include the law and economics movement, overzealous formal and statistical modeling, various reductive theories of human behavior, misguided conceptual analysis in political theory, and the Cambridge school of intellectual history.</p><br><p> As an alternative to all of these, Shapiro makes a compelling case for problem-driven social research, rooted in a realist philosophy of science and an antireductionist view of social explanation. In the lucid--if biting--prose for which Shapiro is renowned, he explains why this requires greater critical attention to how problems are specified than is usually undertaken. He illustrates what is at stake for the study of power, democracy, law, and ideology, as well as in normative debates over rights, justice, freedom, virtue, and community. Shapiro answers many critics of his views along the way, securing his position as one of the distinctive social and political theorists of our time.</p></p><p><br><p>"Ian Shapiro's work has inspired a generation of both scholars and practitioners of politics--for the simple reason that he meets the standards of the former and the needs of the latter. In this book, he helps rescue the study of politics and society from moralists, who believe individuals have more control over their fates than history or economics would support, and from those scientists who view human behavior as mechanistic. He is a theoretician with solid grounding in the real world, a master-observer of the human capacity that is at the heart of the best and worst in political and social life--and everything in between: choice. He writes with a clarity that is refreshing as well as redolent of the confidence he rightly feels in his own judgments."<b>--Strobe Talbott, President of the Brookings Institution</b><br></p><br><p>"With his characteristic boldness and insight, Ian Shapiro surveys the reigning theories in the social sciences and finds them wanting. A superb collection of essays from a trenchant critic."<b>--Joyce Appleby, Professor Emerita of History, University of California, Los Angeles, author of <i>Liberalism and Republicanism in the Historical Imagination</i><br></b><br></p><br><p>"Informed by normative political theory and the philosophy of science, and grounded in a deep knowledge of empirical studies in political science, Ian Shapiro's essays raise fundamental questions for those in all the disciplines--including law--who seek to understand and explain social behavior in the construction of decent public institutions."<b>--Mark Tushnet, Carmack Waterhouse Professor of Constitutional Law, Georgetown University</b><br></p><br><p>"It is always a pleasure to read Ian Shapiro's reflections on political theory, the methodology of political science, and on the state of the discipline. He is sceptical but not cynical, he is critical without malice, and he laces his insights with a dry wit that makes some sometimes quite tough argumentation unusually digestible. It is good to have these pieces so conveniently assembled in one place."<b>--Alan Ryan, New College, Oxford</b><br></p><br><p>"This is an important book for two main reasons. First, its central argument is, undoubtedly, correct. Recent methodological advances in the social sciences, combined with pressures from increased professionalization, have rendered epidemic the 'pathologies' that are the book's subject. Second, Shapiro is one of only a handful of scholars who have drawn social scientists' attention to these problems. The tightly argued essays that comprise the book are written in a clear, jargon-free prose that will make them accessible to scholars across a range of fields and disciplines."<b>--Clarissa Rile Hayward, Ohio State University, author of<i>De-Facing Power</i><br></b><br></p><br><p>"This lucid, brilliant, and beautifully written volume of essays contributes substantially to our understanding of the philosophy and practice of research in the human sciences.

It's directly translated from the Greek and Hebrew texts and is intentionally designed to be a reading Bible rather than a study Bible. Each of the 66 books has an introduction by Peterson, and there are no verse numbers to interrupt the flow of the passages.<p>The vibrant flavor of the text is evident from the opening verses of the book of Genesis: "First this: God created the Heavens and Earth--all you see; all you don't see. Earth was a soup of nothingness, a bottomless emptiness, an inky blackness."</p><p>There's renewed vigor in some of Jesus' most well-known words of the New Testament in John 3: "This is how much God loved the world: He gave his Son, his one and only son. And this is why: so that no one need be destroyed; by believing in him, anyone can have a whole and lasting life. God didn't go to all the trouble of sending his Son merely to point an accusing finger, telling the world how bad it was. He came to help, to put the world right again."</p><p>Whether it's the poetry of the Psalms, the thundering tirades of the Old Testament prophets, or the ageless words of Jesus, Peterson breaths new life into timeless passages in this fresh-voiced paraphrase. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i></p>Voted as &#34;Book of the Decade&#34; by the Academy of Parish Clergy (2003)</p><h2>Games and Information: An Introduction to Game Theory</h2><p>Written in a crisp and approachable style, <i>Games and Information</i> uses simple modeling techniques and straightforward explanations to provide students with an understanding of game theory and information economics. <br> <ul> <li><br> </li> <li>Written for introductory courses seeking a little rigor.<br> </li> <li>The 4th edition brings the material fully up-to-date and includes new end-of-chapter problems and classroom projects, as well as a math appendix.<br> </li> <li>Accompanied by a comprehensive website featuring solutions to problems and teaching notes.</li> </ul></p><p>The first edition of Games and Information was published in 1989, when the topic of game theory was just starting to come to the attention of mainstream economists.

Peter Duus brings a new perspective to Meiji expansionism in this pathbreaking study of Japan's acquisition of Korea, the largest of its colonial possessions. He shows how Japan's drive for empire was part of a larger goal to become the economic, diplomatic, and strategic equal of the Western countries who had imposed a humiliating treaty settlement on the country in the 1850s.<br><br>Duus maintains that two separate but interlinked processes, one political/military and the other economic, propelled Japan's imperialism. Every attempt at increasing Japanese political influence licensed new opportunities for trade, and each new push for Japanese economic interests buttressed, and sometimes justified, further political advances. The sword was the servant of the abacus, the abacus the agent of the sword.<br><br>While suggesting that Meiji imperialism shared much with the Western colonial expansion that provided both model and context, Duus also argues that it was "backward imperialism" shaped by a sense of inferiority vis-�-vis the West. Along with his detailed diplomatic and economic history, Duus offers a unique social history that illuminates the motivations and lifestyles of the overseas Japanese of the time, as well as the views that contemporary Japanese had of themselves and their fellow Asians.</p><p>"This is a major historical work that, in the field of Japanese imperialism, will set a standard for careful and comprehensive analysis. <i>The Abacus and the Sword</i> is the handiwork of a master historian."&#x2014;Mark R.

Yet some English Catholics prospered, reconciling their faith and loyalty to their country. Among the most prominent was George Calvert, a talented and ambitious man who successfully navigated the politics of court and became secretary of state under King James I. A conforming Protestant from the age of twelve, Calvert converted back to Catholicism when a political crisis forced him to resign his position in 1625. The king rewarded Calvert by naming him Baron of Baltimore in Ireland. Insulated by wealth, with the support of powerful friends, and no longer occupied with court business, Baltimore sought to exploit his land grants in Ireland and Newfoundland. Seeking to increase his own fortune and status while enlarging the king's dominions, he embarked on a series of colonial enterprises that eventually led to Maryland.</p><p>The experiences of Calvert and his heirs foster our understanding of politics and faith in Jacobean England. They also point to one of the earliest codifications of religious liberty in America, for in founding Maryland, Calvert and his son Cecil envisioned a prosperous society based on freedom of conscience. In <i>English and Catholic</i>, John D. Krugler traces the development of the "Maryland Designe," the novel solution the Calverts devised to resolve the conflict of loyalty they faced as English Catholics. In doing so, Krugler places the founding and early history of Maryland in the context of pervasive anxieties in England over identity, allegiance, and conscience.</p><p>Explaining the evolution of the Calvert vision, Krugler ties together three main aspects of George Calvert's career: his nationalism and enthusiasm for English imperialism; his aim to find fortune and fame; and his deepening sense of himself as a Catholic. Skillfully told here, the story of the Calverts' bold experiment in advancing freedom of conscience is also the story of the roots of American liberty.</p></p><p><p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, to be English and Catholic was to face persecution, financial penalties, and sometimes death.

Incorporated in this edition is new information about horticultural oils, solarization techniques, and recently introduced biocontrols. Since it deals with crop pests in California, growers outside the state and other mild-temperate/subtropical regions might find some of the information (e.g., pests of citrus and avocado) irrelevant.

Adorno, Bertolt Brecht, Fritz Lang, and Arnold Schoenberg who had fled Nazi Germany. During their years in exile, they would produce a substantial body of major works to address the crisis of modernism that resulted from the rise of National Socialism. Weimar Germany and its culture, with its meld of eighteenth-century German classicism and twentieth-century modernism, served as a touchstone for this group of diverse talents and opinions.<br><br><i>Weimar on the Pacific</i> is the first book to examine these artists and intellectuals as a group. Ehrhard Bahr studies selected works of Adorno, Horkheimer, Brecht, Lang, Neutra, Schindler, D�blin, Mann, and Schoenberg, weighing Los Angeles&#x2019;s influence on them and their impact on German modernism. Touching on such examples as film noir and Thomas Mann&#x2019;s <i>Doctor Faustus</i>, Bahr shows how this community of exiles reconstituted modernism in the face of the traumatic political and historical changes they were living through.</p><p>"Ehrhard Bahr's sophisticated introduction to the Los Angeles of the �migr�s from Nazi Germany is a quintessential 'Hollywood' book: brilliant in casting, sunny in disposition, with hidden film noir touches. Bahr's reading of the central books of this world, by Bert Brecht, Thomas Mann, Alfred D�blin, his insights into Fritz Lang's films and Arnold Schoenberg's operas, make this a major contribution to American, German and world culture." Sander L. Gilman, author of <i>Bertolt Brecht's Berlin</i><br><br> At long last, �migr� Los Angeles has been interpreted from the inside by an accomplished scholar of modern German culture. <i>Weimar on the Pacific</i> is a study of relevance to California, the nation, and contemporary Europe.&#x201d; Kevin Starr, Professor of History, University of Southern California<b>Ehrhard Bahr</b> is distinguished professor emeritus of German at UCLA.</p><h2>The World That Trade Created: Society, Culture, and the World Economy, 1400 to the Present</h2><p>In a series of brief vignettes the authors bring to life international trade and its actors, and also demonstrate that economic activity cannot be divorced from social and cultural contexts. In the process they make clear that the seemingly modern concept of economic globalisation has deep historical roots.</p><p>"If you teach world history from 1500, you'll want to assign this book. It is filled with engaging essays about ordinary people whose day-to-day activities connected them to the global economy. Pomeranz and Topik avoid abstract generalities; instead they offer a truly global buffet of interesting accounts that makes sense of economic history in the modern era--the world that trade created." --Mary Jane Maxwell, Green Mountain College<br><br>"In this new edition, Pomeranz and Topik present a broadly inclusive portrayal of the development of international commerce. The authors blend previously published articles into a coherent series of vignettes that capture the trend of trade over the past 600 years. ... This volume offers a balance to traditional approaches to trade history and is noteworthy for its attention to the role of Asia in the development of world commerce. ... Recommended. Academic audiences, upper-division undergraduate and above; general readers; professionals." --<i>Choice</i><br><br>"Undergraduate or even high school students in world history classes should respond well to the non-academic prose and to the often off-beat topics. ... Professors in world history classes can profitably use <i>The World That Trade Created</i>, as I have, to reinforce concepts covered in lecture or in standard textbooks, as a source for lecture material or for student presentations, or for student papers analyzing one or another course theme." --<i>World History Connected</i></p><h2>ActiveMQ in Action</h2><p><p>Applications in enterprises need to communicate, most commonly done by messaging.

Fifty-five years after the fact the world still ponders the enormity of this disaster. <i>The Holocaust Encyclopedia</i> is the only comprehensive single-volume work of reference providing both a reflective overview of the subject and abundant detail concerning major events, policy decisions, cities, and individuals. Up-to-date and designed for easy access, the encyclopedia presents information on the major aspects of the Holocaust in essays by scholars from eleven countries who draw on a number of sources&#x2014;including recently uncovered evidence from the former Soviet bloc&#x2014;to provide in-depth studies on the political, social, religious, and moral issues of the Holocaust as well as short entries identifying events, sites, and individuals. The book also has more than 250 photographs, many of them rare, and 19 maps.<br><br> The volume includes:<br><br> � <b>Raul Hilberg</b> on concentration camps and Gypsies<br> � <b>Ruth Bondy, Israel Gutman,</b> and <b>Dina Porat</b> on major ghettoes<br> � <b>Roger Greenspun</b> on the Holocaust in cinema and television<br> � <b>Richard Breitman</b> on American policy<br> � <b>Michael Berenbaum</b> on theological and philosophical responses<br> � <b>Saul Friedl�nder</b> on Nazi policy<br> � <b>Michael Hagemeister</b> on the <i>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</i><br> � <b>Michael R. Marrus</b> on historiography<br> � <b>Christopher R. Browning</b> on the Madagascar Plan<br> � <b>Robert S. Wistrich</b> on Holocaust denial<br> � <b>James E. Young</b> on Holocaust literature</p></p><p>Although most libraries now contain many shelves of books describing various aspects of the Holocaust, comprehensive one-volume histories or reference books on the subject are rare. Thus, <i>The Holocaust Encyclopedia</i>, edited by Walter Lacquer (a modern European historian who has taught at Harvard, Brandeis, and Tel Aviv University, among others), fills an important gap in existing Holocaust literature. His book gathers accessible articles by many of the world's leading Holocaust scholars on the full range of people and places involved, from Adolph Hitler and Gypsies to Russia and the Soviet Union. The articles are complemented by a comprehensive chronology and an excellent bibliographical essay, and by almost 300 illustrations, including maps and photographs. The photographs, by Adam Kaczkowski, are particularly well chosen and designed. Photography's importance in the act of Holocaust remembrance is poignantly understated by Roger Greenspun in his entry on "Cinema and Television," in which he writes, "This was the first great human catastrophe to have so many pictures taken of it." <i>The Holocaust Encyclopedia</i> will become the first stop in the library for high school students wishing to learn about the Holocaust. It will also provide college students and adults with a reliable, authoritative, big-picture perspective on aspects of a genocide that, no matter how fully it is known, will never fully be understood. <i>-- Michael Joseph Gross</i><p><b>Walter Laqueur,</b> co-chairman of the International Research Council of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., is among the world&#x2019;s preeminent historians of modern Europe and a leading authority on the Holocaust.

Drawing on a database which is the most extensive of its kind, it reveals for the first time information about sex ratios, ages, from where in the world they came and how they were treated by the criminal justice system. As well as unique statistical data, there are the life stories of ordinary individuals and how they integrated into society.<br><br>This book overturns many of the conventional assumptions that have been made about their lives. They were not enslaved, stigmatised outsiders but woven into English society as government officials, defenders of the country, tradesmen, entertainers and founders of families who have left a legacy of their presence in the form of descendants that in some cases can be traced to the present day.<br><br>The approach is factual rather than theoretical, using the techniques of the genealogist to reconstruct individual lives. It is written in a lucid, accessible style that will make it essential reading not just for academics but for those who are interested in this aspect of English history and may want to learn how to find out more about the black people in their own localities.</p><p>Kathleen Chater is an independent scholar and writer.</p><h2>The Continuum of Literacy Learning, Grades PreK-2: A Guide to Teaching (Fountas &amp; Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System)</h2><p>A combination assessment tool and guide for teaching identifies the literacy goals appropriate to pre-K through grade two and offers tools to help analyze students&#39; strengths and identify areas needing teaching support.</p><p></p><h2>The Elements of Dramatism</h2><p><p> <b> </b> Kenneth Burke was arguably the most important rhetorician and critical theorist of the 20th Century. <i>The Elements of Dramatism <i> is the first pragmatic introduction to the work of Kenneth Burke for those interested in communication and language. <b> </b> </i> </i> This brief paperback focuses on the analytical methods Burke coined as dramatism, which has exerted an enormous influence for many years on people interested in the dynamics of human communication and symbol-use in many areas of study, particularly composition and speech communication. Each chapter includes discussions of key concepts in the context of dramatism and rhetoric, extended applications of these concepts to a variety of rhetorical problems and forms (including literature, photography, and film), and clear guidelines for applying these strategies. Longer applications and illustrations of key concepts are accompanied by readings that elaborate them or serve as sources of analysis.

He lives in Charleston, South Carolina.Cheyenne Raiders<br>1&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>"Mr. Russell," the tall, dark-haired young man called out as he turned in his saddle. "You said we'd reach the Arkansas yesterday. When will we get there?""Soon, pilgrim," the lean, buckskin-clad guide replied laconically.The two riders were eight days out of Independence, Missouri, and far into the Unorganized Territory. It was nearly April of 1837, and the last remnant of the winter's winds raised swirls of yellow dust from the Great Western Desert, but tufts of grass and clumps of tiny yellow and blue flowers had already begun to dot the vast, arid expanse of flatland.Thomas Benton McCabe turned back to the trail ahead and subsided into uncomfortable silence. Phillips Russell had the knack of making him feel foolish, as did many Westerners, despite McCabe's degree from Yale and his four years of reading law in Boston. Hunting and fishing in New England had not prepared him for the hardships of life on the Westernfrontier--no matter what they believed back at the Office of Indian Affairs.He turned in the saddle to look back. His ruddy, boyish face twisted in a frown, as it did almost every time he looked at his pack mules plodding along to the tug of the lead tied to his saddle. Russell, who was going farther, had brought along only one mule, and that was another matter for frustration. Every trader in Independence had sold him something 'nobody tried the plains without,' and now he was weighted down with twice the gear he needed."You'll find out which stuff is worth carrying," Russell said suddenly. McCabe jerked around, but the trapper wasn't even looking at him. "You won't really believe the rest ain't any good till you see it don't work. Then you'll just toss it away. Or trade it. There's always some damned fool ready to buy anything." McCabe colored, but Russell still didn't look at him. "Things you hang on to are your Hawken, your horse, your knife, and them Paterson Colts, in that order. I don't know how good those newfangled revolving pistols will work out here in the heat and the dust and the snow and the rain, but the others will keep you alive." He grinned suddenly and looked over his shoulder at McCabe. "Most important thing to hang on to, of course, is your hair. Won't need any guns if you lose that.""I don't expect to need them anyway. I'm coming peacefully, and you said the Cheyenne would accept me if I showed peaceful intent.""There's others, boy," Russell snorted, pulling his fur cap farther down over his forehead. "You spend much time with the Cheyenne and you'll most likely run into Osage, Kansa, Iowa, Omaha, Pawnee, Ponca, maybe some Sioux, Crow, Blackfoot, Shoshone, Utes, Apache, Kiowa and Comanche. Quite a list, ain't it? And they'll all want to lift your hair. Especially the Kiowa and Comanche.""But I'm just here to write a report for the government. Like dozens of other men. I have no part in Indian conflicts."Russell laughed drily. "If Sitting Bear brings the Kiowa calling, you try telling him that. I'd be right interested to hear what he has to say."McCabe hadn't considered that the Cheyenne's allowing him to stay might put him in danger. The wind suddenly seemed colder, and he tugged his heavy wool coat tighter.Russell suddenly stopped and swung his horse around to face McCabe. "A man back in Independence told me you've got over a hundred pounds of seed corn on those mules," he said. "Is that true? You bringing seed corn out here? To the Cheyenne?""A gift," McCabe replied awkwardly. "I also brought beads, mirrors and hatchets, but I thought seed would be a more useful offering."Russell put back his head and brayed a laugh. "McCabe, I'll be double damned if you ain't going to have a right interesting time with the Cheyenne."McCabe's ears burned, but he kept a rein on his anger. "Mr. Russell, what I do or don't do among the Cheyenne is no concern of yours. You agreed, for forty dollars in gold, that I could accompany you as far as the Arkansas River, and that you would then put me on a trail that would lead to the Cheyenne lands. I'm getting no closer with you sitting here making noises like a jackass."Russell became serious. "You're right where you ought to be. River's about a mile over to the south, but this is the place you want to start from." He pointed to a six-foot-high pile of rocks, on top of which a cow skull had been placed.McCabe squinted. Near the rocks was a stand of cottonwood trees, and the glint of the sun on water."I haven't seen anything like that out here before," he remarked. "There seem to be some sacks pushed into the rocks." He walked his horse closer and bent down out of the saddle to reach for a leather bag."I wouldn't do that, McCabe.""Why not? Is it an Indian shrine? Some religious place?""It ain't Indian. It's sort of like a post office. You got a letter you want mailed back East, you leave it here with a pelt or two. Anybody going from Bent's Fort to Independence or St. Louis has to pass this spot. They stop regular and pick up anything waiting here."McCabe shook his head. "What an undependable way of doing things. Don't the letters and pelts ever get stolen?""I ain't never heard of anyone stealing from this cairn, McCabe. Not even the Indians. They figure it for some kind of white man's shrine. A holy place." Russell spat and licked his dry lips. "I thought you were eager to get on your way, McCabe.""You still haven't shown me the trail.""Well, it ain't exactly a trail the way you likely think of one. You begin at this cairn and head off that way," Russell explained, pointing.McCabe quickly pulled out his compass and checked the direction. West-northwest."Well, I suppose you can use that fancy compass, but all you need to do is to keep the sun over your right shoulder in the morning and in front of your left shoulder in the afternoon. That'll fetch you up among the Cheyenne.""Thank you, Mr. Russell." He stuffed the compass back in his pocket and shook Russell's hand."You take care of yourself, McCabe, and try to hang on to your hair." As he started off at a slow walk, trailing his pack mule, he called back over his shoulder, "You're going to have a right interesting time, McCabe, you and your corn."As the trapper rode away, McCabe was struck by the chill realization that, except for Russell, there was no one else for two hundred and fifty miles but Indians. "Well," he muttered, "that's who I came to see."The contour of the land didn't change much for the next two days, and as McCabe rode through the prairies, he wondered why the Indians there didn't farm. The fertile, black loam was better than most farm soil in New England.Late on the second day, he was sunk deep in his thoughts about farming as he rode along when suddenly his horse shied.He clucked at his mount, then looked around to discover the cause of the animal's alarm. There could be wolves behind one of those dips, or even a grizzly bear, though Russell had said they weren't often seen this far out of the mountains. Swallowing hard, McCabe thumbed back the hammer on his heavy Hawken rifle. It might even be some of those unfriendly Indians the trapper had spoken of, the ones who might want his scalp, he thought.He considered what to do. If he simply rode as fast as he could, he might get away, but he would have to leave the pack mules behind. There'd be no fast riding with them, and despite Russell's admonition, he wasn't yet eager to abandon them.Whatever the horse had shied from seemed to be in front of him andto the left. Keeping the muzzle-loading rifle pointed in that direction, McCabe rode slowly to his right and down into a shallow ground depression.Slowly he worked his way around to his left. Every time the ground rose enough to make him visible, he kicked his horse into a trot, risking the extra noise to make his way into the next draw quickly. There were no sounds except his own, but his eyes darted warily over every bush.Suddenly his mount started again, and he had to saw at the reins to keep it from breaking into a run. The mules stamped their feet and blew nervously. Quickly his eyes probed the low bushes clinging to the sides of the gully, his rifle following his gaze. Nothing moved, but the animals still wanted to be out of there.Abruptly he let out an exclamation. Under a bush, where his gaze had already passed twice, was a man's hand. He climbed down and ran to pull the bush aside."I'll be damned," he muttered.Underneath lay an unconscious Indian, huddled up as if he had crawled there to hide before passing out. He was easily as tall as Tom, and he wore three feathers fastened in his hair. A necklace of beads and claws hung across his bare chest. His left leg was bent unnaturally below the knee, and its leather covering was stained dark.Quickly he picketed his animals, hacked a pit in the side of the draw with his knife, and built a small fire. Putting water on to boil, he returned to the Indian.The man stirred slightly as McCabe cut away the bottom of the legging. A sharp point of white bone stuck through the Indian's swollen flesh. Tom was no doctor, but to him the wound looked at least a day old. He took the boiling water off the fire to cool, then cut two straight branches and dug a spare shirt out of his pack to tear up for bandages. The man groaned as Tom washed the puffed, purple flesh, but there was no use in waiting. He swiftly set the leg, pulling until the bone disappeared and gently probing the distended limb to align the broken ends. When the leg was finally splinted and bandaged, he got the man down to the fire and covered him with a blanket.An hour later, over a plate of beans and dried beef, McCabe suddenly became aware of being watched. He filled another tin plate and held it out to the Indian, but the man's dark, unblinking eyes stayed on Tom's face.After a minute Tom set the plate where the other could reach it if he chose."How is your name called?" the man said in a hoarse voice."You speak English!" McCabe exclaimed. "McCabe. My name is Thomas Benton McCabe."Mack Cabe," the other said slowly, shaking his head at the strangeness of the sound. "I am called Spotted Fox. I am a stranger to you. Maybe an enemy. Why have you helped me?""Your leg looked pretty bad, and there was nobody else around but me." He shifted awkwardly under the injured man's unwavering stare and wondered angrily why he should feel as if he had done something wrong.After a minute Spotted Fox picked up the plate and began to push beans and meat into his mouth with his fingers. He talked between swallows. "Two days ago a snake frightened my pony. We fell into a draw. My leg was broken, and the pony ran away. I have crawled far, but today I could crawl no more. I sang my spirit-song and hid myself in the bush to await what would come. Then you came to help me, Mack Cabe, though you are not of my tribe. Our legends tell us that men with white skins will come and bring destruction to my people. But you helped me.""I don't bring anyone destruction, Spotted Fox. In fact, I don't even know the name of your tribe.""I am of the <i>Tsis-tsis-tas,"</i> Spotted Fox answered proudly. "The Real People. White men call us the Cheyenne.""This is a piece of luck," McCabe said eagerly. "I'm looking for the Cheyenne. My government wants to know about your people. My chiefs in Washington wish to befriend the chiefs of your tribe.""Your chiefs wish to learn of us," Spotted Fox stated, "because we avoid the white man. Perhaps you wish to learn of us as the mountain lion does the deer.""I bring no threat of harm to your people, Spotted Fox. I come in peace.""Peace," the Indian grunted. "All white men say they come in peace. The hair-faces come and take all our beaver. They think because women of other tribes will take any man to their blankets, our women will also. They do not speak our language, not even the sign-talk, but they call us ignorant because we do not speak their tongue. They give firewater to rob a man ofhis brains, then trade trinkets for all of his furs. Is this your peace, Mack Cabe?""I don't want any furs, and I don't have any whiskey." He was uncomfortably aware of Spotted Fox's gaze on him. "I'm afraid I don't speak your language either. What's this sign-talk you mentioned?""It is way that men who do not speak each other's tongue may talk." He pointed at McCabe. "You." He touched his chest with his thumb. "Me. I." An index finger straight up in front of the chin. "Man." He made a sweeping motion beside his head as if to comb long hair. "Woman."After showing McCabe a few more signs, Spotted Fox lay back with a sigh. "I am tired. Tomorrow I will show you more as we ride."Long after the other man had fallen asleep, McCabe sat watching him. Spotted Fox had shown him the sign for lie, too: forked fingers moved in front of the mouth to represent the tongue of a snake. His lie was a small one. He did mean no harm to the Cheyenne, but he had the uncomfortable feeling Spotted Fox wouldn't understand if the whole story were told to him.He thought back to the day when this adventure had all begun.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Washington was crowded. McCabe had just arrived from Boston. He took a room in a hotel and hurried up Pennsylvania Avenue to the grey stone building that housed the Department of War."I'm looking for the Office of Indian Affairs," he told a bored clerk at the reception desk. "I have an appointment with Mr. Charles Madden.""Second floor," the man said, barely giving him a glance. "First right at the top of the stairs. You'll see the plaque on the door."The clerk's indifference couldn't dampen McCabe's enthusiasm. He climbed the stairs and found a door with a brass plate. Inside sat a thin, bald man, his sharp nose almost touching a ledger as he wrote in crabbed handwriting."Mr. Madden?""Mr. Madden isn't here today." The bald man didn't even stop writing as he spoke.""But I have an appointment for ten o'clock today, and it's five minutes of."The man stopped writing with a heavy sigh. "You can't see Mr. Madden if he isn't here, now can you? Why don't you come back and try again tomorrow?""Will Mr. Madden be here then?""I don't know. Mr. Madden is a very busy man.""But ...""See here. Among other matters, there is, at present, a war being fought with the Seminole, the Republic of Texas is objecting to our resettlement of Indians west of the Mississippi, and the Utes are raising havoc on the western frontier. There are a great many problems in this office, beside which your appointment counts for very little."If you'll just let me explain," he persisted, taking a letter from his pocket. "This is an acceptance of my application to work for the Office of Indian Affairs. It says I am to be here at ten o'clock today to receive an assignment from Mr. Charles Madden. If Mr. Madden isn't here, perhaps someone else can help me."The other man took the letter and perused it sourly. "Thomas Benton McCabe. That's you, eh? Yale, class of 1832. That won't do you much good with the savages. I see you're one of the special appointees. That means you'll be making a report on a Western tribe.""That's what I was told...</p><h2>The Glimpses Of The Moon</h2><p>Set in the 1920s, <i>The Glimpses of the Moon</i> details the romantic misadventures of Nick Lansing and Susy Branch, a couple with the right connections but not much in the way of funds. They devise a shrewd bargain: they'll marry and spend a year or so sponging off their wealthy friends, honeymooning in their mansions and villas. As Susy explains, "We should really, in a way, help more than hamper each other. We both know the ropes so well; what one of us didn't see the other might -- in the way of opportunities, I mean." The other part of the plan states that if either one of them meets someone who can advance them socially, they're each free to dissolve the marriage. How their plan unfolds is a comedy of eros that will charm all fans of Wharton's work.</p><p>Edith Wharton&nbsp;(1862&#x2013;1937) was an American novelist&#x2014;the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for her novel&nbsp;<i>The Age of Innocence&nbsp;</i>in 1921&#x2014;as well as a short story writer, playwright, designer, reporter, and poet. Born into one of New York's elite families, she drew upon her knowledge of upper class aristocracy to realistically portray the lives and morals of the Gilded Age.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>It rose for them -- their honey-moon -- over the waters of a lake so famed as the scene of romantic raptures that they were rather proud of not having been afraid to choose it as the setting of their own.<br><br>"It required a total lack of humour, or as great a gift for it as ours, to risk the experiment," Susy Lansing opined, as they hung over the inevitable marble balustrade and watched their tutelary orb roll its magic carpet across the waters to their feet.<br><br>"Yes -- or the loan of Strefford's villa," her husband emended, glancing upward through the branches at a long low patch of paleness to which the moonlight was beginning to give the form of a white house-front.<br><br>"Oh, come -- when we'd five to choose from. At least if you count the Chicago flat."<br><br>"So we had -- you wonder!" He laid his hand on hers, and his touch renewed the sense of marvelling exultation which the deliberate survey of their adventure always roused in her....It was characteristic that she merely added, in her steady laughing tone: "Or, not counting the flat -- for I hate to brag -- just consider the others: Violet Melrose's place at Versailles, your aunt's villa at Monte Carlo -- <i>and</i> a moor!"<br><br>She was conscious of throwing in the moor tentatively, and yet with a somewhat exaggerated emphasis, as if to make sure that he shouldn't accuse her of slurring it over. But he seemed to have no desire to do so. "Poor old Fred!" he merely remarked; and she breathed out carelessly: "Oh, well --"<br><br>His hand still lay on hers, and for a long interval, while they stood silent in the enveloping loveliness of the night, she was aware only of the warm current running from palm to palm, as the moonlight below them drew its line of magic from shore to shore.<br><br>Nick Lansing spoke at last. "Versailles in May would have been impossible: all our Paris crowd would have run us down within twenty-four hours. And Monte Carlo is ruled out because it's exactly the kind of place everybody expected us to go. So -- with all respect to you -- it wasn't much of a mental strain to decide on Como."<br><br>His wife instantly challenged this belittling of her capacity. "It took a good deal of argument to convince you that we could face the ridicule of Como!"<br><br>"Well, I should have preferred something in a lower key; at least I thought I should till we got here. Now I see that this place is idiotic unless one is perfectly happy; and that then it's -- as good as any other."<br><br>She sighed out a blissful assent. "And I must say that Streffy has done things to a turn. Even the cigars -- <i>who</i> do you suppose gave him those cigars?" She added thoughtfully: "You'll miss them when we have to go."<br><br>"Oh, I say, don't let's talk to-night about going. Aren't we outside of time and space...? Smell that guinea-a-bottle stuff over there: what is it? Stephanotis?"<br><br>"Y-yes....I suppose so. Or gardenias....Oh, the fire-flies! Look...there, against that splash of moonlight on the water. Apples of silver in a net-work of gold...."They leaned together, one flesh from shoulder to finger-tips, their eyes held by the snared glitter of the ripples.<br><br>"I could bear," Lansing remarked, "even a nightingale at this moment...."<br><br>A faint gurgle shook the magnolias behind them, and a long liquid whisper answered it from the thicket of laurel above their heads.<br><br>"It's a little late in the year for them: they're ending just as we begin."<br><br>Susy laughed. "I hope when our turn comes we shall say good-bye to each other as sweetly."<br><br>It was in her husband's mind to answer: "They're not saying good-bye, but only settling down to family cares." But as this did not happen to be in his plan, or in Susy's, he merely echoed her laugh and pressed her closer.<br><br>The spring night drew them into its deepening embrace. The ripples of the lake had gradually widened and faded into a silken smoothness, and high above the mountains the moon was turning from gold to white in a sky powdered with vanishing stars. Across the lake the lights of a little town went out, one after another, and the distant shore became a floating blackness. A breeze that rose and sank brushed their faces with the scents of the garden; once it blew out over the water a great white moth like a drifting magnolia petal. The nightingales had paused and the trickle of the fountain behind the house grew suddenly insistent.<br><br>When Susy spoke it was in a voice languid with visions. "I have been thinking," she said, "that we ought to be able to make it last at least a year longer."<br><br>Her husband received the remark without any sign of surprise or disapprobation; his answer showed that he not only understood her, but had been inwardly following the same train of thought.<br><br>"You mean," he enquired after a pause, "without counting your grandmother's pearls?"<br><br>"Yes -- without the pearls."<br><br>He pondered a while, and then rejoined in a tender whisper: "Tell me again just how."<br><br>"Let's sit down, then. No, I like the cushions best."<br><br>He stretched himself in a long willow chair, and she curled up on a heap of boat-cushions and leaned her head against his knee. Just above her, when she lifted her lids, she saw bits of moon-flooded sky incrusted like silver in a sharp black patterning of plane-boughs. All about them breathed of peace and beauty and stability, and her happiness was so acute that it was almost a relief to remember the stormy background of bills and borrowing against which its frail structure had been reared. "People with a balance can't be as happy as all this," Susy mused, letting the moonlight filter through her lazy lashes.<br><br>People with a balance had always been Susy Branch's bugbear; they were still, and more dangerously, to be Susy Lansing's. She detested them, detested them doubly, as the natural enemies of mankind and as the people one always had to put one's self out for. The greater part of her life having been passed among them, she knew nearly all that there was to know about them, and judged them with the contemptuous lucidity of nearly twenty years of dependence. But at the present moment her animosity was diminished not only by the softening effect of love but by the fact that she had got out of those very people more -- yes, ever so much more -- than she and Nick, in their hours of most reckless planning, had ever dared to hope for.<br><br>"After all, we owe them <i>this.!"</i> she mused.<br><br>Her husband, lost in the drowsy beatitude of the hour, had not repeated his question; but she was still on the trail of the thought he had started. A year -- yes, she was sure now that with a little management they could have a whole year of it! "It" was their marriage, their being together, and away from bores and bothers, in a comradeship of which both of them had long ago guessed the immediate pleasure, but she at least had never imagined the deeper harmony.<br><br>It was at one of their earliest meetings -- at one of the heterogeneous dinners that the Fred Gillows tried to think "literary" -- that the young man who chanced to sit next to her, and of whom it was vaguely rumoured that he had "written," had presented himself to her imagination as the sort of luxury to which Susy Branch, heiress, might conceivably have treated herself as a crowning folly. Susy Branch, pauper, was fond of picturing how this fancied double would employ her millions: it was one of her chief grievances against her rich friends that they disposed of theirs so unimaginatively.<br><br>"I'd rather have a husband like that than a steamyacht!" she had thought at the end of her talk with the young man who had written, and as to whom it had at once been clear to her that nothing his pen had produced, or might hereafter set down, would put him in a position to offer his wife anything more costly than a row-boat.<br><br>"His wife --! As if he could ever have one! For he's not the kind to marry for a yacht either." In spite of her past, Susy had preserved enough inner independence to detect the latent signs of it in others, and also to ascribe it impulsively to those of the opposite sex who happened to interest her. She had a natural contempt for people who gloried in what they need only have endured. She herself meant eventually to marry, because one couldn't forever hang on to rich people; but she was going to wait till she found some one who combined the maximum of wealth with at least a minimum of companionableness.<br><br>She had at once perceived young Lansing's case to be exactly the opposite: he was as poor as he could be, and as companionable as it was possible to imagine. She therefore decided to see as much of him as her hurried and entangled life permitted; and this, thanks to a series of adroit adjustments, turned out to be a good deal. They met frequently all the rest of that winter; so frequently that Mrs. Fred Gillow one day abruptly and sharply gave Susy to understand that she was "making herself ridiculous."<br><br>"Ah --" said Susy with a long breath, looking her friend and patroness straight in the painted eyes.<br><br>"Yes," cried Ursula Gillow in a sob, "before you interfered Nick liked me awfully...and, of course, I don't want to reproach you...but when I think...."<br><br>Susy made no answer. How could she, when <i>she</i> thought? The dress she had on had been given her by Ursula; Ursula's motor had carried her to the feast from which they were both returning. She counted on spending the following August with the Gillows at Newport...and the only alternative was to go to California with the Bockheimers, whom she had hitherto refused even to dine with.<br><br>"Of course, what you fancy is perfect nonsense, Ursula; and as to my interfering --" Susy hesitated, and then murmured: "But if it will make you any happier I'll arrange to see him less often...." She sounded the lowest depths of subservience in returning Ursula's tearful kiss....<br><br>Susy Branch had a masculine respect for her word; and the next day she put on her most becoming hat and sought out young Mr. Lansing in his lodgings. She was determined to keep her promise to Ursula; but she meant to look her best when she did it.<br><br>She knew at what time the young man was likely to be found, for he was doing a dreary job on a popular encyclopaedia (V to X), and had told her what hours were dedicated to the hateful task. "Oh, if only it were a novel!" she thought as she mounted his dingy stairs; but immediately reflected that, if it were the kind that she could bear to read, it probably wouldn't bring him in much more than his encyclopaedia. Miss Branch had her standards in literature....<br><br>The apartment to which Mr. Lansing admitted her was a good deal cleaner, but hardly less dingy, than his staircase. Susy, knowing him to be addicted to Oriental archaeology, had pictured him in a bare room adorned by a single Chinese bronze of flawless shape, or by some precious fragment of Asiatic pottery. But such redeeming features were conspicuously absent, and no attempt had been made to disguise the decent indigence of the bed-sitting-room.<br><br>Lansing welcomed his visitor with every sign of pleasure, and with apparent indifference as to what she thought of his furniture. He seemed to be conscious only of his luck in seeing her on a day when they had not expected to meet. This made Susy all the sorrier to execute her promise, and the gladder that she had put on her prettiest hat; and for a moment or two she looked at him in silence from under its conniving brim.<br><br>Warm as their mutual liking was, Lansing had never said a word of love to her; but this was no deterrent to his visitor, whose habit it was to speak her meaning clearly when there were no reasons, worldly or pecuniary, for its concealment. After a moment, therefore, she told him why she had come; it was a nuisance, of course, but he would understand. Ursula Gillow was jealous, and they would have to give up seeing each other.<br><br>The young man's burst of laughter was music to her; for, after all, she had been rather afraid that being devoted to Ursula might be as much in his day's work as doing the encyclop�dia.<br><br>"But I give you my word it's a raving-mad mistake! And I don't believe she ever meant <i>me,</i> to begin with --" he protested; but Susy, her common-sense returning with her reassurance, promptly cut short his denial.<br><br>"You can trust Ursula to make herself clear on such occasions. And it doesn't make any difference what <i>you</i> think. What matters is what <i>she</i> believes."<br><br>"Oh, come! I've got a word to say about that too, haven't I?"<br><br>Susy looked slowly and consideringly about the room. There was nothing in it, absolutely nothing, to show that he had ever possessed a spare dollar -- or accepted a present.<br><br>"Not as far as I'm concerned," she finally pronounced.<br><br>"How do you mean? If I'm as free as air --?"<br><br>"I'm not."<br><br>He grew thoughtful. "Oh, then, of course --. It only seems a little odd," he added drily, "that in that case, the protest should have come from Mrs. Gillow."<br><br>"Instead of coming from my millionaire bridegroom? Oh, I haven't any; in that respect I'm as free as you."<br><br>"Well, then --? Haven't we only got to stay free?"<br><br>Susy drew her brows together anxiously. It was going to be rather more difficult than she had supposed.<br><br>"I said I was as free in that respect. I'm not going to marry -- and I don't suppose you are?"<br><br>"God, no!" he ejaculated fervently.<br><br>"But that doesn't always imply complete freedom...."<br><br>He stood just above her, leaning his elbow against the hideous black marble arch that framed his fireless grate. As she glanced up she saw his face harden, and the colour flew to hers.<br><br>"Was that what you came to tell me?" he asked.<br><br>"Oh, you don't understand -- and I don't see why you don't, since we've knocked about so long among exactly the same kind of people." She stood up impulsively and laid her hand on his arm. "I do wish you'd help me --!"<br><br>He remained motionless, letting the hand lie untouched.<br><br>"Help you to tell me that poor Ursula was a pretext, but that there is someone who -- for one reason or another -- really has a right to object to your seeing me too often?"<br><br>Susy laughed impatiently. "You talk like the hero of a novel -- the kind my governess used to read. In the first place I should never recognize that kind of right, as you call it -- never!"<br><br>"Then what kind do you?" he asked with a clearing brow.<br><br>"Why -- the kind I suppose you recognize on the part of your publisher." This evoked a hollow laugh from him. "A business claim, call it," she pursued. "Ursula does a lot for me: I live on her for half the year. This dress I've got on now is one she gave me.

She takes us back to the Alexandria of Hypatia's day, with its Library and Museion, pagan cults and the pontificate of Saint Cyril, thriving Jewish community and vibrant Greek culture, and circles of philosophers, mathematicians, astronomers, and militant Christians. Drawing on the letters of Hypatia's most prominent pupil, Synesius of Cyrene, Dzielska constructs a compelling picture of the young philosopher's disciples and her teaching.

Devices like Galileo&#39;s Track, Coupled Pendulum, and Gum-Wrapper Thermostat will help you teach forces, energy, properties of matter, and much more. Best of all, you don&#39;t need an engineering degree to assemble these devices. The book provides such detailed instructions that even novices can handle the necessary tasks and tools. If You Build It is organized into two practical parts: 1. Step-by-step directions for producing 17 well-designed pieces of equipment that author Bruce Yeany has tested in his own classroom. Each set of instructions is illustrated with clear photos or drawings and includes a materials list. 2. Suggestions for how to teach with each piece of equipment. Yeany provides information to prepare students for the demonstration, ideas for the presentation itself, and interactive questions to verify that students are learning the physics concepts. When you can&#39;t find or afford high-quality equipment from a catalog... or wish you could make your gear bigger or smaller... or simply find it satisfying to use devices you ve put together yourself, If You Build It has your solution. Developing your own demonstrations can even enrich your understanding of the physics concepts you wish to teach. The experience creates an environment rich in opportunities for observing and investigating. Teach physics your way with custom-made demos.</p><p>From gum-wrapper thermostats to string racers, these contraptions will add a hands-on element to physics lectures. The devices are easy to build and made from inexpensive materials.

The authors identify the central features of effective, time-limited interventions for individuals, couples, families, and groups. Taking a developmental approach to treatment, they explain how brief therapy can help at different times in a patient's life, as changes and transitions bring on new stresses and challenges. A practical framework is provided for selecting and screening patients, rapidly finding a focus for clinical work, and making optimal use of available time. Case examples and extensive transcripts are included to illustrate the use of strategies and techniques drawn from many different psychotherapy perspectives. Throughout, the focus is on creative and efficient ways to help patients build on existing strengths and make desired changes in their interactions with others. <br></p><p>Simon H.

Organizations now operate in a global environment. New technologies continue to disrupt how, when, and where work is done and should be managed. The workforce is becoming more diverse. Sustainability has joined profitability as a key business goal. All of this has dramatically accelerated the pace of change, making recruiting the best talent&#x2014;not simply filling positions&#x2014;an overriding concern. <br><br> But too many organizations still use a job-based, bureaucratic talent management approach that doesn&#x2019;t take into account how the world has changed. Indeed, a recent study showed that from 1995 to 2016, there was no significant change in the way HR spends its time.<br><br> Lawler says that talent management has to be reinvented. It needs to be closely linked to the organization&#x2019;s overall strategy. Recruitment and talent management should be driven by the skills and competencies the organization needs for long-term growth. This means talent management requires agile systems that can respond quickly to changing conditions and that take a more individualized approach to evaluating and rewarding performance. And everything talent management does has to be based on evidence, not tradition. <br><br> Lawler looks at attracting, selecting, developing, rewarding, managing, and organizing talent through this new lens. In today&#x2019;s world, organizations have to constantly reinvent themselves&#x2014;and talent management must do the same.</p><p>Edward E. Lawler III is a distinguished professor of business and director of the Center for Effective Organizations in the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California. Businessweek proclaimed him one of the top six gurus in the field of management, and Human Resource Executive called him one of the human resource field&#x2019;s most influential people. Workforce magazine identified him as one of the twenty-five visionaries who have shaped today&#x2019;s workplace over the past century. He is the recipient of many awards, including the Society for Human Resource Management&#x2019;s Michael R. Losey Award, of which he was the first recipient. He is the author of over 400 articles and 50 books.&#x201c;Ed Lawler continues to be the iconic thinker in the HR field. This book offers both a synthesis of what has happened in talent and a forward-looking preview to what is next. Ed has a unique knack for identifying future trends and offering advice on how to deal with them. What a marvelous contribution that shapes both theory and practice.

But what are the new assumptions? Who better to help us understand this than Professor Lawler? In this fine and meticulously researched book, he shows the path forward. An absolute must-read for talent management executives.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;Lynda Gratton, Professor of Management Practice, London Business School<br> </i></b> <br> &#x201c;Ed Lawler has once again taken conventional wisdom and rethought, reshaped, and reinvented it. <i>Reinventing Talent Management </i>helps operations and HR leaders utilize talent management as a competitive strategic weapon, with a bias toward agility, differentiation, and analytics-based decision making.

Ed Lawler&#x2019;s three-pronged prescription is timeless: link talent management closely to the organization&#x2019;s overall strategy; develop agile approaches to recruitment, staffing, performance management, and rewards that can respond quickly to changing conditions; and base everything you do on evidence, not tradition.

Looking past the day-to-day operations of a school library, Farmer's book serves as a reality check: school libraries must align with school mission statements and policies, while simultaneously negotiating for proper budgets and resources alongside other departments. It's a daunting prospect, but Farmer demonstrates how it can be done with the proper attention and systematic planning.&nbsp; Taking a deeper, more professional look at management that applies theories and principles to real-world situations, this book<br><ul><li>introduces the concept of school library programs and provides an overview of school library program management;</li><li>examines professional and legislated standards for school libraries, and discusses the part a manager plays in meeting them; </li><li>links management with leadership, differentiating the two, and showing how the school librarian can carry out both roles;</li><li>helps readers assess their own skills, knowledge, and dispositions in order to set short-term and long-term goals;</li><li>explains how to manage resources and learning environments to meet the needs of teachers, administrators, parents, and other stakeholders;</li><li>offers guidance for developing and working with budgets, obtaining additional funding, and using collaboration to support the school library program;</li><li>provides concrete advice on hiring, training, supervising, assessment, and recognizing library workers and other library team members; and</li><li>includes tools for communicating effectively and getting the message across.</li></ul>More than just a compendium of management theories, this book provides much food for thought that will help readers gain important insights into their own roles as school library managers and leaders.</p><p>Lesley S. J. Farmer coordinates the Library Media Teacher program at California State University Long Beach, where she also serves as a reference librarian for the university s library. She is the author and co-author of numerous books, including Technology Infused Instruction for the Educational Community (Scarecrow, 2004) and Information Literacy Assessment in K-12 Settings (Scarecrow, 2007).School librarians who are balancing the demands of curriculum and teaching, collection development, and technology may not see themselves as managers or leaders, but according to Farmer, they are. The author emphasizes how, beyond vision and mission statements, librarians need to take the time to analyze what it means to manage a successful school library in order to strengthen their programs. Delving into what an ideal school library program looks like and how the library should align with school goals, she challenges readers to examine their own schools and their cultures and to consider their personal management styles. Many helpful resources are included in each chapter, along with a list of references. "Managing Resources" offers some useful tools for maintaining print and electronic materials. In "Managing Funding," the author refers readers to websites that provide fund-raising advice, but there is no listing for library grants. That omission notwithstanding, the content is valuable. Throughout, "Food for Thought" boxes raise questions for contemplation. Each chapter ends by encouraging users to apply the tenets of school librarianship to themselves. VERDICT Whether readers have just begun their careers or have years of experience, they will benefit from this thorough dissection of each aspect of managing a school library.

Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).<br> &nbsp;<br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i>&nbsp;(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br> &nbsp;<br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include&nbsp;<i>Sweet Thursday</i>&nbsp;(1954),&nbsp;<i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i>&nbsp;(1957),&nbsp;<i>Once There Was a War</i>&nbsp;(1958),&nbsp;<i>The Winter of Our Discontent&nbsp;</i>(1961),<i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i>&nbsp;(1962),&nbsp;<i>America and Americans</i>&nbsp;(1966), and the posthumously published&nbsp;<i>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>Viva Zapata!</i>(1975),&nbsp;<i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i>&nbsp;(1976), and&nbsp;<i>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1989).<br> &nbsp;<br> Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the United States Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B.

He mastered nearly the entirety of the antecedent Christian exegetical and theological tradition, both Greek and Latin, and he knew Hebrew and Aramaic. We have the fruit of that knowledge in his most famous editorial achievement, the Latin Vulgate translation of the Bible. Declared "the greatest doctor in explaining the Scriptures" by the Council of Trent, Jerome has been regarded by the Latin Church as its preeminent scriptural commentator. Much of Jerome's prodigious exegetical output, however, has never been translated into English. In this volume, Thomas P. Scheck presents the first English translation of St. Jerome's commentaries on Galatians, Titus, and Philemon. Jerome followed the Greek exegesis of Origen of Alexandria, proceeding step by step and producing the most valuable of all of the patristic commentaries on these three epistles of St. Paul. Jerome's exegesis is characterized by extensive learning, acute historical and theological criticism, lively and vigorous exposition, and homiletical exhortation. Scheck's translation is supplemented with thorough annotations and a detailed critical introduction that sets the context for reading Jerome's commentaries. It is an invaluable reference for patristics scholars, historical theologians, Church historians, and New Testament scholars.</p> <p>"Scheck's introduction is clearly written and lucid, containing fine theological observations as well as a clear historical context for Jerome's commentary. Scheck's excellent translation comes at a most opportune time given that interest in patristic exegesis is high and Jerome is among the best of the ancient commentators on Galatians." --Joseph T. Lienhard, S.J., Fordham University</p></p><p>Thomas P. Scheck is assistant professor of classics and theology at Ave Maria University.

The book focuses on four unifying &#39;legends&#39; recounted by contemporary subjects: the first two, redolent of antiquity, are the &#39;observing of signs&#39; and &#39;granting of seasons&#39; by ancient sage kings; and the other two, redolent of modernity, involve the pursuit of &#39;accuracy&#39; and historical &#39;accumulation&#39; to this end. Juxtaposing legend with the messy realities of practice, Morgan reveals how such narratives were told, imagined, and re-imagined in response to evolving tensions. He argues that, whether or not &#39;empiricism&#39; and &#39;progress&#39; are real, we must consider the real effects of such narratives as believed in and acted upon in the history of astronomy in China.</p><p>Responding to monolithic modern narratives about &#39;Chinese science&#39;, Morgan examines the astral sciences in early China as a study in the disunities of Chinese scientific cultures and the narratives by which ancients and moderns alike have fought to instil them with a sense of unity.Daniel Patrick Morgan is a researcher at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, (CNRS) Laboratoire SPHERE (Sciences, Philosophie, Histoire), Universit� Paris Diderot, having previously graduated from the University of Chicago.

Old Dudley is a Texan whose religion is oil, and in his fifty years of searching for it he has destroyed a dozen good geologists, &#34;crushing them to dust by manipulating their own desires against them.&#34; His most recent victim is Matthew, his daughter Mel&#39;s sometime lover, who grew up in Swan Valley in Montana, where Mel has been living and studying wolves for twenty years. The valley is Old Dudley&#39;s albatross. He and Matthew have drilled nineteen dry holes there, and sensing that Matthew is burning out, Dudley sends in a new geologist, Wallis. Seduced by the valley and by Mel, Wallis discovers the dark mystery of Dudley&#39;s life, yet he cannot escape the old man&#39;s grip. As in all Rick Bass&#39;s fiction, both the land and the characters are unforgettable. Swan Valley, connected to the out</p><p>Rick Bass has already proved himself to be a master of the short form, producing both stellar fiction (<i>In the Loyal Mountains</i>) and eloquent polemical pieces (<i>The Book of Yaak</i>). The loose and baggy expanse of the novel, however, is new terrain for him. In an Amazon.com interview, Bass described his struggles with <i>Where the Sea Used to Be</i>, which involved 14 years of intermittent labor and thousands of discarded pages. Reading the book, it's easy to see why. Bass's first novel is a massive work. Encapsulating motifs from his entire career, it revolves around an elaborate love triangle (or perhaps quadrangle), the permutations of which would take a short pamphlet to describe. On the most basic level, however, there's Old Dudley, a crusty petroleum geologist; his daughter Mel, who's spent the last two decades studying wolves in Montana's Swan Valley; Matthew, a former prot�g� of Dudley's; and Wallis, Dudley's <i>current</i> prot�g�, who he's sent to the valley in search of oil, oil, and more oil.<p> Given Mel's conservationist bent and her father's expoitative one--not to mention the usual family baggage--it's no surprise that these two are antagonists. There are also Oedipal fireworks galore, as the two younger men alternately resist and succumb to Dudley's long-distance manipulations. But more to the point, <i>Where the Sea Used to Be</i> is a novel about clashing obsessions: personal, spiritual, and environmental. Occasionally this works to the story's detriment, as one character after another speechifies on behalf of his or her b�te noir. (The author, too, is guilty on this count, having inserted a number of italicized lectures into the text.) But despite this flaw, and the sometimes creaky machinery of the plot, <i>Where the Sea Used to Be</i> offers an abundance of riches--not the least of them being Bass's patented, time-lapse lyricism: "The moose walked off into the trees--disappeared into the branchy whispers of fir, pine, and spruce, fitting back into the woods like an arrow passing between two ribs. A mist of snow trickled from one of the branches where the moose had gone--it caught the moonlight and glittered as it fell--and then there was no sign. The woods sealed back in around her." Nobody is more persuasive when it comes to describing a place, along with the animals--human and otherwise--who occupy it.</p>Rick Bass is the author of twelve books of fiction and nonfiction, including Winter, Oil Notes, Platte River, In the Loyal Mountains, The Lost Grizzlies, Book of Yaak, and The Sky, The Stars, The Wilderness. His short stories have appeared in a wide range of periodicals and anthologies. He is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, a gran from the National Endowment for the Arts and a PEN/Nelson Algren citation for his 1988 book, The Watch. He lives with his family on a remote ranch in Montana&#39;s Yaak Valley.</p><h2>Healthy Gut, Flat Stomach Drinks: 75 Low-FODMAP Tonics, Smoothies, Infusions, and More</h2><p><p><strong><strong>Tasty drinks your tummy will love</strong></strong></p><p>Poorly digested sugars and carbohydrates are often the cause of discomfort.

(And stage play editions go back to the 1890s.) For many lost films of early Hollywood, photoplay editions can be the most tangible reminders that they ever existed. The most popular, such as <i>Dracula, Frankenstein,</i> and <i>King Kong,</i> sell for thousands of dollars on those rare occasions when they are offered. <p> Two text chapters trace the history of photoplay editions to the present and discuss the major and minor publishers and the various formats that developed. The condition, popularity, demand, and value of photoplay edition books are also discussed. Part One is a list of American (including Canadian) photoplay editions listed by book title and including such details as the author, publisher, date published, alternate titles, type of dust jacket and the number of photographic stills, main credits, and the estimated value in U.S. dollars. Part Two is a simple list by author of these photoplay editions. Parts Three and Four follow the same format but are listings of British (including Australian) photoplay editions. Part Five lists stage play editions by book title (with full data) and Part Six is a simple list of stage play editions by actor or actress.</p></p><p>Retired from the United States Navy, <b>Rick Miller</b> is an associate editor of <i>Linn&#x2019;s Stamp News.</i> He lives in Troy, Ohio.</p><h2>How Dare We!

I can even see this anthology being used in a composition class.

At its heart is the conviction that there is an objective and universal justice which transcends humanity's particular expressions of justice. It asserts that there are certain ways of behaving which are appropriate to humanity simply by virtue of the fact that we are all human beings. Recent political debates indicate that it is not a tradition that has gone unchallenged: in fact, the opposition is as old as the tradition itself. </p><p>By distinguishing between philosophy and ideology, by recalling the historical adventures of natural law, and by reviewing the theoretical problems involved in the doctrine, Simon clarifies much of the confusion surrounding this perennial debate. He tackles the questions raised by the application of natural law with skill and honesty as he faces the difficulties of the subject. </p><p>Simon warns against undue optimism in a revival of interest in natural law and insists that the study of natural law beings with the analysis of "the law of the land." He writes not as a polemicist but as a philosopher, and he writes of natural law with the same force, conciseness, lucidity and simplicity which have distinguished all his other works.</p></p><p>The tradition of natural law is one of the foundations of Western civilization.

What does it mean to those who write? Born from the interplay of natural and cultural history, the seemingly magical act of writing has continually expanded our consciousness. Portrayed in mythology as either a gift from heroes or a curse from the gods, it has been used as both an instrument of power and a channel of the divine; a means of social bonding and of individual self-definition. Now, as the revolution once wrought by the printed word gives way to the digital age, many fear that the art of writing, and the nuanced thinking nurtured by writing, are under threat. But writing itself, despite striving for permanence, is always in the midst of growth and transfiguration.</p><p>Celebrating the impulse to record, invent, and make one's mark, Matthew Battles reenchants the written word for all those susceptible to the power and beauty of writing in all of its forms.</p> 15 illustrations</p><p>Matthew Battles is the author of Palimpsest and Library: An Unquiet History and a program fellow at the Berkman Center of Harvard University, where he is associate director of metaLAB, a research group exploring the bounds of networked culture.&#x201c;This fascinating exploration of the evolution of writing shows how, despite radical technological changes, the practice maintains its atavistic mystery....

Also set out are the reactions of Americans to the various waves of immigration from the rise of the antiforeign Nativists, Know Nothing, and Ku Klux Klan elements; to the restrictive immigration laws and quotas of the 1920s; through the World War II era incarceration of Japanese Americans in "resettlement camps."

Katherine Hayles poses this question at the beginning of this bracing exploration of the idea that we think through, with, and alongside media. As the age of print passes and new technologies appear every day, this proposition has become far more complicated, particularly for the traditionally print-based disciplines in the humanities and qualitative social sciences. With a rift growing between digital scholarship and its print-based counterpart, Hayles argues for contemporary technogenesis&#x2014;the belief that humans and technics are coevolving&#x2014;and advocates for what she calls comparative media studies, a new approach to locating digital work within print traditions and vice versa.</p> <p>Hayles examines the evolution of the field from the traditional humanities and how the digital humanities are changing academic scholarship, research, teaching, and publication. She goes on to depict the neurological consequences of working in digital media, where skimming and scanning, or &#x201c;hyper reading,&#x201d; and analysis through machine algorithms are forms of reading as valid as close reading once was. Hayles contends that we must recognize all three types of reading and understand the limitations and possibilities of each. In addition to illustrating what a comparative media perspective entails, Hayles explores the technogenesis spiral in its full complexity. She considers the effects of early databases such as telegraph code books and confronts our changing perceptions of time and space in the digital age, illustrating this through three innovative digital productions&#x2014;Steve Tomasula&#x2019;s electronic novel, <i>TOC</i>; Steven Hall&#x2019;s <i>The Raw Shark Texts</i>; and Mark Z. Danielewski&#x2019;s <i>Only Revolutions</i>.</p> <p> </p> <p>Deepening our understanding of the extraordinary transformative powers digital technologies have placed in the hands of humanists, <i>How We Think</i> presents a cogent rationale for tackling the challenges facing the humanities today.</p></p><p><b>N. Katherine Hayles</b> is a postmodern literary critic and the James B. Duke Professor of Literature at Duke University.<p>&#x201c;<i>How We Think</i> offers a comprehensive account of how humanities scholars and students apprehend their work differently in the context of the digital turn. The perfect fusion of N. Katherine Hayles&#x2019;s characteristically lucid technical explanations and virtuosic literary analyses, this book navigates the divide between the traditional and digital humanities and shows us how they might in fact intellectually stimulate and support each other.

Hayles thoroughly supports her argument for technogenesis, providing concrete examples of the coevolution of humans and technics. She also explores the nuanced construction of temporality, spatiality, narrative, and database that occurs at the interface between human and technological beings. Whether or not we are prepared to welcome this intersection into our lives and work, it is already present and inextricable.&#x201d;<br> (<i>Kairos</i>)</p><h2>Dombey &amp; Son (Oxford World's Classics)</h2><p>Mr. Dombey's idealistic vision of his "Dombey and Son" shipping firm rests on the shoulders of his delicate son Paul.

This approachable volume responds to that pressing need.<br><br> Drawing on the contributions of psychoanalytic scholars as well as multicultural and feminist psychologists, Pratyusha Tummala-Narra presents a theoretical framework that reflects the realities of clients&#x2019; lives and addresses the complex sociocultural issues that influence their psychological health.<br><br> Psychoanalytic theory proves to be particularly valuable in exploring unconscious processes, recurrent themes, and transference and counter-transference.<br><br> In examining these questions, the author provides engaging case illustrations from her own clinical practice, as well as findings from her research with youth of immigrant origin.</p><p><b>Pratyusha (Usha) Tummala-Narra</b> received her doctorate in clinical psychology at Michigan State University. She is an associate professor in the Department of Counseling, Developmental and Educational Psychology at Boston College; a teaching associate in psychiatry at the Cambridge Health Alliance/Harvard Medical School; and in independent practice in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the course of her career, Dr. Tummala-Narra has held several academic and clinical positions in Massachusetts, Michigan, and Washington, DC. Her research interests focus on the intersections of culture, race, gender, immigration, and trauma, and culturally informed psychotherapy practice. Her clinical scholarship has focused on psychoanalytic perspectives on the relationship between sociocultural context and identity and its influence on the therapeutic process.<br> &nbsp;Tummala-Narra has gathered our dispersed ideas in psychoanalytic thinking about difference and expertly fashioned an important and clinically astute framework. Her ideas are rich and generative. Reading her book was invigorating and challenging, like a consult with a wise and trusted colleague. --<b>PsycCRITIQUES</b></p><h2>Euripides, Vol. VIII: Oedipus-Chrysippus &amp; Other Fragments (Loeb Classical Library, No. 506)</h2><p><p>Eighteen of the ninety or so plays composed by Euripides between 455 and 406 BCE survive in a complete form and are included in the first six volumes of the Loeb Euripides. A further fifty-two tragedies and eleven satyr plays, including a few of disputed authorship, are known from ancient quotations and references and from numerous papyri discovered since 1880. No more than one-fifth of any play is represented, but many can be reconstructed with some accuracy in outline, and many of the fragments are striking in themselves. The extant plays and the fragments together make Euripides by far the best known of the classic Greek tragedians.</p><p>This edition of the fragments, concluded in this second volume, offers the first complete English translation together with a selection of testimonia bearing on the content of the plays.

Tanks roaring over farmlands, pregnant mothers tortured, their babies stolen and sold on the black market, homes raided in the dead of night, ordinary citizens kidnapped and never seen again--such were the horrors of Argentina's Dirty War. Now, in <em>A Lexicon of Terror</em>, Marguerite Feitlowitz fully exposes the nightmare of sadism, paranoia, and deception the military dictatorship unleashed on the Argentine people, a nightmare that would claim over 30,000 civilians from 1976 to 1983 and whose leaders were recently issued warrants by a Spanish court for the crime of genocide. Feitlowitz explores the perversion of language under state terrorism, both as it's used to conceal and confuse ("The Parliament must be disbanded to rejuvenate democracy") and to domesticate torture and murder. Thus, citizens kidnapped and held in secret concentration camps were "disappeared"; torture was referred to as "intensive therapy"; prisoners thrown alive from airplanes over the ocean were called "fish food." Based on six years of research and moving interviews with peasants, intellectuals, activists, and bystanders, <em>A Lexicon of Terror</em> examines the full impact of this catastrophic period from its inception to the present, in which former torturers, having been pardoned and released from prison, live side by side with those they tortured.<br> Passionately written and impossible to put down, Feitlowitz shows us both the horror of the war and the heroism of those who resisted and survived--their courage, their endurance, their eloquent refusal to be dehumanized in the face of torments even Dante could not have imagined.</p><p>Argentina still struggles as a nation with the shame and horror of the so-called "dirty-war" of the decade following Juan Peron's death. During that horrific time, torture and kidnapping were the instruments of choice for the enforcement of political will. Feitlowitz unflinchingly examines life under sadistic military rule with detailed descriptions of the experiences of prisoners in concentration camps. The Argentinean vocabulary now includes words like <i>desaparacido</i> (disappeared person) and <i>chupado</i> (sucked up or kidnapped), vivid reminders of how commonplace kidnapping and murder became. Victims, often guilty only of nothing more than practicing psychology or journalism or being Jewish, have not been forgotten. <p> Though Feitlowitz touches on the linguistic effects of government terrorism in Argentina, her book's greatest strength lies in the voice it gives the victims. The author spent years talking to survivors of the terror as well as some of the people responsible for instigating it. What <i>A Lexicon of Terror</i> does particularly well is capture the ongoing consequences of the dirty war--victims encountering their tormentors on the streets, Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo still marching to remind their government that the fates of thousands of disappeared are still not known, a government held hostage by the fear of army uprisings should any attempt to bring culprits to justice be made. Argentina is the subject of this particular <i>Lexicon</i>, but surely the citizens of other nations such as Chile, Guatemala, and El Salvador might see their own experiences mirrored here.</p><br><strong>Marguerite Feitlowitz</strong> teaches scholarly writing and literary translation at Harvard University.

As in her fire-burst collection Tender Hooks (2004), motherhood is addressed with earthy directness, but Fennelly&#x2019;s imagination runs rampant here as she writes with sass and purpose about the plague of kudzu, and the difference between cold and correct Illinois and hot and sly Mississippi. She also pays incisive tribute to the painter Berthe Morisot in a startlingly empathic series of concise and slashing poems, and to poet John Berryman in the complex &#x201c;Dream Song Cycle.&#x201d; A true pleasure to read, Fennelly is gloriously womanly, dancing-on-the-table daring, and supersmart. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Struwwelpeter: Fearful Stories and Vile Pictures to Instruct Good Little Folks</h2><p>A new edition for adults of the classic children&#39;s stories also includes a World War II-era parody entitled &#34;Struwwelhitler&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Student Solutions Manual for Chemical Principles</h2><p>This is slightly used.</p><p>Carl Hoeger Laurence Lavelle Yinfa Ma</p><h2>Star Ancestors: Indian Wisdomkeepers Share the Teachings of the Extraterrestrials</h2><p>Interviews with American Indian spiritual leaders concerning the long-standing contact that has existed between their tribes and extraterrestrial visitors.<p></p><p><br>� First time that Indian wisdomkeepers have shared with the outside world their knowledge of extraterrestrials and their teachings.</p><p><br>� Includes more than eighty color illustrations by prominent Indian artists.</p><p><br>� Among those interviewed are Dawnland founder Dana Pictou, Mayan Day-keeper Hunbatz Men, Choctaw wisdomkeeper Sequoyah Trueblood, and Creek healer and artist Shona Bear Clark. </p><p><br>American Indian relationships with extraterrestrials have existed since the beginning of time.&nbsp; The creation stories of Indian people say, "We came from the stars"; evidence of Indian contact with ETs has been carved on rocks and hides, choreographed in sacred dances, and beaded on wampum belts over many thousands of years.

The second language of the title, English, supplanted Mueller&#x2019;s native language when she came to the United States from Hitler&#x2019;s Germany at age fifteen. But other second languages are at work here as well. The poems in this collection have to do with memory and metaphor, two forces that enable us to interpret our experience. Each is in a sense a second language, and in Mueller&#x2019;s employ each gains expression in an imaginative and humanistic voice. In &#x201c;English as a Second Language,&#x201d; the various meanings of <i>Second Language</i> come together lucidly and effectively.</p></p><p>Lisel Mueller was born in Hamburg, Germany in 1924.

Fopdoodle, salmagundi, kissingcrust, runnion and stingo are all endangered for lack of use. Since Samuel Johnson completed his dictionary scores of words such as fizgig, jobbernowl and sponk have slipped away from common usage. You will very likely never have heard of most of them while some will be known but not used. Scores of others have definitions so obscure that you wonder why a word was needed at all. Was it necessary to have quite so many different words to describe the less fortunate members of society? Many, such as atom (cannot be split) and urinal (where water is kept for inspection) have changed their meaning completely, often with hilarious consequences. Some, such as tea (lately drunk in Europe) and coffee (comforteth the brain and heart) are included to provide a glimpse of life 250 years ago. Others, such as Dragon (perhaps imaginary) and Swallow (a bird that hides in winter) show as yet unfilled gaps in understanding. This book, Fopdoodle and Salmagundi will delight anyone who is fascinated by the evolution, humor and eccentricity of the English language or enjoys the challenge of a word game. In compiling this selection of little used and unfrequented gems of the language the editor makes the simple request that you slip them into conversation in the hope that their use will be perpetuated. They really are too go to lose.</p><p>Samuel Johnson LL.D. 1709 - 1784, often referred to simply as Dr Johnson, was one of England&#39;s greatest literary figures: a poet, essayist, biographer, lexicographer and often considered the finest critic of English literature. He was also a great wit and prose stylist whose bons mots are still frequently quoted in print today. Between 1747 and 1755, Johnson wrote his best-known work, A Dictionary of the English Language.</p><h2>Ubuntu Made Easy: A Project-based Introduction to Linux</h2><p>Ubuntu brings Linux to the masses, but it can still be intimidating for newbies, neophytes, and geeks-in-training.

It adopts an American political development approach in order to show how the past, present, and visions of the future interact to shape governing institutions and political forces. There is a strong emphasis on the role of ideas. Two key political development principles - path dependency and critical choice - are central to explaining how and why the past affects the present and future. Each chapter begins with an opening vignette that epitomizes the key themes of the chapter. The book&#39;s developmental approach does not diminish the attention it gives to current matters but it does provide a richer context for the appreciation and understanding of the whole gamut of attitudes, behaviors, organizational activities, and institutional relationships that comprise American political and governmental life.</p><p>This book takes an American political development approach to explicate the fundamentals of American politics and government. It prompts students to consider and understand how the past shapes the present and future of American politics and government. It goes beyond simply describing the essentials of American government and politics to show how those essentials came to be, why they persist, and why they change.Marc Landy is Professor of Political Science at Boston College and the winner of the 2009 Boston College Phi Beta Kappa Teaching Award, Phi Beta Kappa Omicron of Massachusetts.

It also acquired a reputation, especially in California, as a railroad that people loved to hate. This magisterial history tells the full story of the Southern Pacific for the first time, shattering myths about the company that have prevailed to this day. A landmark account, <i>Sunset Limited </i>explores the railroad's development and influence&#x2015;especially as it affected land settlement, agriculture, water policy, and the environment&#x2015;and offers a new perspective on the tremendous, often surprising, role the company played in shaping the American West. <br><br>Based on his unprecedented and extensive research into the company's historical archives, Richard Orsi finds that, contrary to conventional understanding, the Southern Pacific Company identified its corporate well-being with population growth and social and economic development in the railroad's hinterland. As he traces the complex and shifting intersections between corporate and public interest, Orsi documents the railroad's little-known promotion of land distribution, small-scale farming, scientific agriculture, and less wasteful environmental practices and policies&#x2015;including water conservation and wilderness and recreational parklands preservation. <br><br>Meticulously researched, lucidly written, and judiciously balanced, <i>Sunset Limited </i>opens a new window onto the American West in a crucial phase of its development and will forever change our perceptions of one of the largest and most important western corporations in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p><p>"An extraordinary book by a master historian! Orsi demonstrates that the Southern Pacific was not simply a predatory corporation obsessed with maximizing its profits and political power; it had a strong sense of the public good and a devotion to building stable, prosperous communities. This superb book should be required reading for all historians of the West, business, and the environment."&#x2015;Donald J. Pisani, author of <i>Water and American Government</i><br><br>&#x201c;This deep and extensive examination of the Southern Pacific's development activities in California will encourage readers to look beyond the overblown rhetoric of the railroad's many political enemies and see afresh its many positive economic accomplishments as it worked to build the Twentieth-Century West.

She casts new light on Dickinson's temperament, her aesthetic sensibility, and her vision of the relationship between art and nature, revealing that the successful gardener's intimate understanding of horticulture helped shape the poet's choice of metaphors for every experience: love and hate, wickedness and virtue, death and immortality.</p><p>Gardening, Farr demonstrates, was Dickinson's other vocation, more public than the making of poems but analogous and closely related to it. Over a third of Dickinson's poems and nearly half of her letters allude with passionate intensity to her favorite wildflowers, to traditional blooms like the daisy or gentian, and to the exotic gardenias and jasmines of her conservatory. Each flower was assigned specific connotations by the nineteenth century floral dictionaries she knew; thus, Dickinson's association of various flowers with friends, family, and lovers, like the tropes and scenarios presented in her poems, establishes her participation in the literary and painterly culture of her day. A chapter, "Gardening with Emily Dickinson" by Louise Carter, cites family letters and memoirs to conjecture the kinds of flowers contained in the poet's indoor and outdoor gardens. Carter hypothesizes Dickinson's methods of gardening, explaining how one might grow her flowers today.</p><p>Beautifully illustrated and written with verve, <i>The Gardens of Emily Dickinson</i> will provide pleasure and insight to a wide audience of scholars, admirers of Dickinson's poetry, and garden lovers everywhere.</p></p><p>Cuttings from the book: &#34;The pansy, like the anemone, was a favorite of Emily Dickinson because it came up early, announcing the longed-for spring, and, as a type of bravery, could withstand cold and even an April snow flurry or two in her Amherst garden. In her poem the pansy announces itself boldly, telling her it has been &#39;resoluter&#39; than the &#39;Coward Bumble Bee&#39; that loiters by a warm hearth waiting for May.&#34; &#34;She spoke of the written word as a flower, telling Emily Fowler Ford, for example, &#39;thank you for writing me, one precious little &#34;forget-me-not&#34; to bloom along my way.&#39; She often spoke of a flower when she meant herself: &#39;You failed to keep your appointment with the apple-blossoms, &#39; she reproached her friend Maria Whitney in June 1883, meaning that Maria had not visited her . . . Sometimes she marked the day or season by alluding to flowers that had or had not bloomed: &#39;I said I should send some flowers this week . . . [but] my Vale Lily asked me to wait for her.&#39;&#34; &#34;People were also associated with flowers . . . Thus, her loyal, brisk, homemaking sister Lavinia is mentioned in Dickinson&#39;s letters in concert with sweet apple blossoms and sturdy chrysanthemums . . . Emily&#39;s vivid, ambitious sister-in-law Susan Dickinson is mentioned in the company of cardinal flowers and of that grand member of the fritillaria family, the Crown Imperial.&#34;<p>Judith Farr is Professor Emerita of English &amp; American Literature at Georgetown University.</p><p>Louise Carter is a professional landscape gardener and horticulturalist.</p></p><h2>Contemporary Issues in Business Ethics</h2><p>CONTEMPORARY ISSUES IN BUSINESS ETHICS, 6E introduces readers to business ethics by focusing on the influence of market mechanisms and social values on workplace norms.

Since the first expert systems appeared in the late sixties, we have seen three decades of research and development engineer human knowledge to more practical ends, in a pioneering effort that has integrated diverse areas of cognitive and computer science. Today, expert systems exist in many forms, from medical diagnosis to investment analysis and from counseling to production control.<br> <br>This third edition of Peter Jackson's best-selling book updates the technological base of expert systems research and embeds those developments in a wide variety of application areas. The earlier chapters have been refocused to take a more practical approach to the basic topics, while the later chapters introduce new topic areas such as case-based reasoning, connectionist systems and hybrid systems. Results in related areas, such as machine learning and reasoning with uncertainty, are also accorded a thorough treatment. <br> <br>The new edition contains many new examples and exercises, most of which are in CLIPS, a language that combines production rules with object-oriented programming. LISP, PROLOG and C++ are also featured where appropriate. Interesting problems are posed throughout, and are solved in exercises involving the analysis, design and implementation of CLIPS programs. <br> <br>This book will prove useful to a wide readership including general readers, students and teachers, software engineers and researchers. Its modular structure enables readers to follow a pathway most suited to their needs, providing them with an up-to-date account of expert systems technology.<br> <br>Peter Jackson is Director of Research at West Group, a division of The Thomson Corporation and the leading provider of information to the US legal market.

This comprehensive book compiles past efforts to get computers to reason like experts as well as explaining how today's expert systems work.<p> The notable strength of this title is the author's impressive command of the computer science literature in the field of AI and expert systems. In chapter after chapter, the author reviews research-quality (and some production-level) projects that have attempted to reproduce human expertise using computers in such areas as medical diagnosis. Besides explaining essential expert system topics such as knowledge representation and the rules used for arriving at decisions, this book also provides numerous samples using the CLIPS programming language. </p><p> This textbook-style treatment of this subject features plenty of mathematical notation (such as the propositional calculus) and exercises at the end to stimulate your own thinking. For the general reader, the author's explanation of the history of AI (which has offered mixed results in the face of high expectations in the 1980s, for instance) is quite accessible and probably worth the price of the book. Rich with detail for the expert, this title shows off the best of expert systems--both in the past and today--as well as the reasonably bright prospects for the future of intelligent machines that think more like human experts. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: Introduction to expert systems; representing knowledge; history of artificial intelligence (AI) research: Classical, Romantic, and Modern Periods; knowledge representation: STIPS and MYCIN applications; symbolic representation and LISP; rule-based and canonical systems; associative nets and frame systems: graphs, trees, and networks; object-oriented programming and its usefulness in expert systems; programming languages: LOOPS, Flavors, CLOS, CLIPS, C++, and PROLOG; uncertainty and fuzzy logic; knowledge acquisition; heuristic classification; strategies for problem solving; blackboard architectures; machine learning; police networks; case-based reasoning (CBR); hybrid systems; and the future of expert systems.</p><p> <b>Peter Jackson</b> is Director of Research at West Group, a division of The Thomson Corporation and the leading provider of information to the US legal market.

A Berlin celebrity and a major figure in the Enlightenment, revered by Immanuel Kant, Mendelssohn suffered the indignities common to Jews of his time while formulating the philosophical foundations of a modern Judaism suited for a new age. His most influential books included the groundbreaking <i>Jerusalem</i> and a translation of the Bible into German that paved the way for generations of Jews to master the language of the larger culture.</p><p>Feiner&#x2019;s book is the first that offers a full, human portrait of this fascinating man&#x2014;uncommonly modest, acutely aware of his task as an intellectual pioneer, shrewd, traditionally Jewish, yet thoroughly conversant with the world around him&#x2014;providing a vivid sense of Mendelssohn&#x2019;s daily life as well as of his philosophical endeavors. Feiner, a leading scholar of Jewish intellectual history, examines Mendelssohn as father and husband, as a friend (Mendelssohn&#x2019;s long-standing friendship with the German dramatist Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was seen as a model for Jews and non-Jews worldwide), as a tireless advocate for his people, and as an equally indefatigable spokesman for the paramount importance of intellectual independence.<br><br><b>About Jewish Lives:&nbsp;</b><br><br> Jewish Lives is a prizewinning series of interpretative biography designed to explore the many facets of Jewish identity. Individual volumes illuminate the imprint of Jewish figures upon literature, religion, philosophy, politics, cultural and economic life, and the arts and sciences. Subjects are paired with authors to elicit lively, deeply informed books that explore the range and depth of the Jewish experience from antiquity to the present.<br><br> In 2014, the Jewish Book Council named Jewish Lives the winner of its Jewish Book of the Year Award, the first series ever to receive this award.<br><br><b>More praise for Jewish Lives:</b><br><br> "Excellent."&nbsp;&#x2013;New York Times<br><br> "Exemplary."&nbsp;&#x2013;Wall Street Journal<br><br> "Distinguished."&nbsp;&#x2013;New Yorker<br><br> "Superb."&nbsp;&#x2013;The Guardian</p></p><p><b>Shmuel Feiner</b> is professor of Modern Jewish History at&nbsp;Bar&nbsp;Ilan&nbsp;University&nbsp;and holds the Samuel Braun Chair for the History of the Jews in&nbsp;Prussia.

Feiner describes Mendelssohn's intellectual and social ascent in a tight, concise narrative."&#x2014;Publishers Weekly (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"In&nbsp;extensive quotations from Mendelssohn&#x2019;s many works, Feiner provides an introduction to Mendelssohn&#x2019;s open, humanist thought and hopes, as well as his abiding fear that Jews would never attain full civil standing without sacrificing their religious tradition. Mendelssohn&#x2019;s letters often reveal his disappointments and the burden he carried as spokesman for the Jewish community to both the governmental authorities and intellectual elite, defending Judaism even as he attempted to purge it of rabbinic authority and insularity. Feiner is particularly sensitive to Mendelssohn&#x2019;s desire for a life of study, enriched by family and his salon of likeminded friends and thinkers, even as he was thrust time and again into the public arena."&#x2014;Maron L. Waxman, Jewish Book Council (Maron L. Waxman <i>Jewish Book Council</i>)<br><br>"Feiner's <i>Moses Mendelssohn</i> serves as a useful introduction to this complex figure, and fills a longstanding need for a short, accessible biography . . . .

With that "Westphalian" picture of political space assumed by default, the scope of justice was rarely subject to open dispute. Today, however, human-rights activists and international feminists join critics of structural adjustment and the World Trade Organization in challenging the view that justice can only be a domestic relation among fellow citizens. Targeting injustices that cut across borders, they are making the scale of justice an object of explicit struggle.<br><br>Inspired by these efforts, Nancy Fraser asks: What is the proper frame for theorizing justice? Faced with a plurality of competing scales, how do we know which one is truly just? In exploring these questions, Fraser revises her widely discussed theory of redistribution and recognition. She introduces a third, "political" dimension of justice&#x2014;representation&#x2014;and elaborates a new, reflexive type of critical theory that foregrounds injustices of "misframing." Engaging with thinkers such as J�rgen Habermas, John Rawls, Michel Foucault, and Hannah Arendt, she envisions a "postwestphalian" mapping of political space that accommodates transnational solidarity, transborder publicity, and democratic frame-setting, as well as emancipatory projects that cross borders. The result is a sustained reflection on who should count with respect to what in a globalizing world.</p><p>Revising her widely discussed theory of redistribution and recognition, Nancy Fraser introduces a "political" dimension of justice&#x2014;representation&#x2014;and elaborates a new, reflexive type of critical theory that foregrounds injustices of "misframing."

In 1947, shortly after India gained independence, the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru initiated a vast plan of modernization throughout the country, during which Chandigarh became the administrative capital of the Punjab province. Nehru commissioned Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret to construct this capital from scratch, with the sole instruction that they should be expressive and experimental and should not let themselves be hindered by tradition. Illustrated with photographs dating from the time period to the present, this book documents the architectural project and the production of the furniture, offering a definitive summary of this epic modernist enterprise. A further chapter is dedicated to the work of Lucien Herv�, the famous architectural photographer who depicted the city extensively.<br>The architect, urban planner, painter, writer, designer and theorist Charles-Edouard Jeanneret, known as <b>Le Corbusier</b>, was born in Switzerland in 1887. In 1922 Le Corbusier and his cousin <b>Pierre Jeanneret</b> opened an architectural studio in Paris, inaugurating a partnership that would last until 1940. They began experimenting with furniture design after inviting the architect Charlotte Perriand to join the studio in 1928. After World War II, they sought efficient ways to house large numbers of people in response to the urban housing crisis. In the 1950s a unique opportunity to realize their concepts on a grand scale presented itself in the construction of Chandigarh. Before his death in 1965, Le Corbusier established the Fondation Le Corbusier in Paris to look after and make available to scholars his library, architectural drawings, sketches and paintings.</p><p></p><h2>The Finite Element Method in Electromagnetics (IEEE Press)</h2><p><b>A new edition of the leading textbook on the finite element method, incorporating major advancements and further applications in the field of electromagnetics</b> <p>The finite element method (FEM) is a powerful simulation technique used to solve boundary-value problems in a variety of engineering circumstances.

Miles Ogborn relates and connects the stories of monarchs and merchants, planters and pirates, slaves and sailors, captives and captains, reactionaries and revolutionaries, artists and abolitionists from all corners of the globe. These dramatic stories give new life to the exploration of the history and geography of changing global relationships, including settlement in North America, the East India Company&#39;s trade and empire, transatlantic trade, the slave trade, the rise and fall of piracy, and scientific voyaging in the Pacific. Through these many biographies, including those of Anne Bonny, Captain Cook, Queen Elizabeth I, Pocahontas, and Walter Ralegh, early modern globalisation is presented as something through which different people lived in dramatically contrasting ways, but in which everyone played a part.</p><p>Fascinating account of Britain&#39;s rise as a global imperial power told through dramatic biographical narratives of over forty individuals.

This book reveals how the brains of various vertebrates are astoundingly similar in some ways, while in others they are quite different. The authors examine how the form of the brain is modified and magnified to perfect and capitalize on a specific function, making any particular animal a "specialist" in its area. They also clarify the forms and functions of the nervous system that have allowed vertebrates to adapt to almost every aspect of the earth's environment.</p> <p>Comparative Vertebrate Neuroanatomy: Evolution and Adaptation is a long-awaited text that creates numerous educational possibilities...</p> <p>"This work is virtually unique in the field and would definitely fill a void... an incredible tour de force..." &#x2014;Thomas E.

For three and a half years, Nansen kept a secret diary on tissue-paper-thin pages later smuggled out by various means, including inside the prisoners' hollowed-out breadboards.<br><br>Unlike writers of retrospective Holocaust memoirs, Nansen recorded the mundane and horrific details of camp life as they happened, "from day to day." With an unsparing eye, Nansen described the casual brutality and random terror that was the fate of a camp prisoner. His entries reveal his constantly frustrated hopes for an early end to the war, his longing for his wife and children, his horror at the especially barbaric treatment reserved for Jews, and his disgust at the anti-Semitism of some of his fellow Norwegians. Nansen often confronted his German jailors with unusual outspokenness and sometimes with a sense of humor and absurdity that was not appreciated by his captors.<br><br>After the Putnam's edition received rave reviews in 1949, the book fell into obscurity. In 1956, in response to a poll about the "most undeservedly neglected" book of the preceding quarter-century, Carl Sandburg singled out <i>From Day to Day</i>, calling it "an epic narrative," which took "its place among the great affirmations of the power of the human spirit to rise above terror, torture, and death." Indeed, Nansen witnessed all the horrors of the camps, yet still saw hope for the future. He sought reconciliation with the German people, even donating the proceeds of the German edition of his book to German refugee relief work. Nansen was following in the footsteps of his father, Fridtjof, an Arctic explorer and humanitarian who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1922 for his work on behalf of World War I refugees. (Fridtjof also created the "Nansen passport" for stateless persons.)<br><br>Forty sketches of camp life and death by Nansen, an architect and talented draftsman, provide a sense of immediacy and acute observation matched by the diary entries. The preface is written by Thomas Buergenthal, who was "Tommy," the ten-year-old survivor of the Auschwitz Death March, whom Nansen met at Sachsenhausen and saved using his extra food rations. Buergenthal, author of <i>A Lucky Child</i>, formerly served as a judge on the International Court of Justice at The Hague and is a recipient of the 2015 Elie Wiesel Award from the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.</p><p><b>Odd Nansen</b>, a Norwegian architect, organized relief efforts for Jews and other refugees beginning in 1936, and was imprisoned by the Nazis in a series of concentration camps.

Boyce</b> practiced law for thirty-five years, most recently as the managing partner of the Charlotte office of Dechert LLP, an international law firm."This extraordinary diary by a non-Jewish victim of the Nazi regime and its collaborators is a rich historical document. Nansen's stunning illustrations provide a pictorial narrative into the concentration camp world he endured. Superbly translated by Katherine John, his text renders his experience in clear, muscular prose. We see through his eyes and imagine what he describes. We follow him, day by day, as his diary traverses three and a half years--an eternity at that time--and moves with him from the Norwegian camp system, the Norwegian regime, and occupied Norway to his perspective on the German camp of Sachsenhausen, the Nazi regime in Germany, and the final disintegration of the Third Reich.<br>Timothy Boyce's introduction frames the diary beautifully, setting the diary years into the larger picture of Nansen's life with just the right balance between the private and the public.

There have been plenty of other accounts of imprisonment and concentration camps but none by a man like Mr. Nansen. Writing with no thought of publication, merely to keep a record for his wife and to express his own boiling emotions, Mr. Nansen somehow created a remarkable book.

Like a fresh wind, Sam Keen sweeps away tired self-help nostrums and reams of "bad advice from Dr. Lonelyhearts" to reveal a stunningly new map of love in all its forms.<br>Love is not something we "fall" into, claims Keen, but a complex art combining many skills and talents that take a lifetime to learn fully. At the center of his book are sixteen distinct "elements of love": ranging from <i>attention</i>--a precious gift we can bestow on co-worker, friend, child, and spouse alike--to more exclusive gifts like <i>desire</i> and <i>sexuality</i>. Combining stories, poems and quotes with insights from modern psychology and spiritual tradition, Keen brilliantly explores the elements of <i>memory</i> and <i>solitude</i> in love, the importance of both <i>enjoyment</i> and <i>commitment</i>, and how we can cultivate the essential qualities of <i>empathy</i> and <i>compassion</i>. Each piece ends with suggestions for strengthening our daily practice of the element, so that we constantly enlarge our ability to love in all our relationships.<br>The final section of the book is a soaring meditation on the claim that "those who love know God," an invitation to experience our place in the universe through the eyes of love.</p><p>The author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Fire In the Belly</i> turns his attention to love: what it is, why we try to attain it, and how to succeed at it. Sam Keen, a philosopher with Ivy League credentials, is able to write in a flowing, conversational style that conveys poetic ideas in accessible and subtly humorous prose. <i>To Love and Be Loved</i> is a hybrid of a psychological self-help text and a romantic memoir. Keen the scholar found himself studying Keen the lover. "In the course of writing this book, I have been frequently embarrassed to discover that I know more <i>about</i> love than I put into practice," Keen admits in a typically humble passage.<b>Sam Keen</b> is a noted author and lecturer who has written thirteen books on philosophy and religion. He earned graduate degrees from the Harvard Divinity School and Princeton University, and spent twenty years working as an editor of&nbsp;<i>Psychology Today</i>. Keen coproduced the Emmy-nominated PBS documentary&nbsp;<i>Faces of the Enemy</i>, and was the subject of a PBS special with Bill Moyers entitled&nbsp;<i>Your Mythic Journey with Sam Keen</i>. When not writing or traveling around the world lecturing and giving seminars on a wide range of topics, Keen cuts wood, tends to his farm in the hills above Sonoma, takes long hikes, and practices the flying trapeze.</p><h2>Andersonville</h2><p>&#x201c;<b>The greatest of our Civil War novels&#x201d; (<i>New York Times</i>) reissued for a new generation </b><br><br>As the United States prepares to commemorate the Civil War&#x2019;s 150th anniversary, Plume reissues the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning novel widely regarded as the most powerful ever written about our nation&#x2019;s bloodiest conflict. MacKinlay Kantor&#x2019;s <i>Andersonville</i> tells the story of the notorious Confederate Prisoner of War camp, where fifty thousand Union soldiers were held captive&#x2014;and fourteen thousand died&#x2014;under inhumane conditions. This new edition will be widely read and talked about by Civil War buffs and readers of gripping historical fiction.</p><p>MACKINLAY KANTOR (1904-1977) was the distinguished author of more than thirty books and numerous screenplays.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes there was a compulsion which drew Ira Claffey from his plantation and sent him to walk the forest. It came upon him at eight o&#x2019;clock on this morning of October twenty-third; he responded, he yielded, he climbed over the snake fence at the boundary of his sweet potato field and went away among the pines.</p><p>Ira Claffey had employed no overseer since the first year of the war, and had risen early this morning to direct his hands in the potato patch. Nowadays there were only seven and one-half hands on the place, house and field, out of a total Negro population of twelve souls; the other four were an infant at the breast and three capering children of shirt-tail size.</p><p>Jem and Coffee he ordered to the digging, and made certain that they were thorough in turning up the harvest and yet gentle in lifting the potatoes. Nothing annoyed Ira Claffey like storing a good thirty-five bushels in a single mound and then losing half of them through speedy decay.</p><p>In such a manner, he thought, have some of our best elements and institutions perished. One bruise, one carelessness, and rot begins. Decay is a secret but hastening act in darkness; then one opens up the pine bark and pine straw&#x2014;or shall we say, the Senate?&#x2014;and observes a visible wastage and smell, a wet and horrid mouldering of the potatoes. Or shall we say, of the men?</p><p>In pursuit of his own husbandry on this day, Ira carried a budding knife in his belt. While musing in bed the night before, he had been touched with ambition: he would bud a George the Fourth peach upon a Duane&#x2019;s Purple plum.</p><p>Veronica was not yet asleep, but reading her Bible by candlelight beside him. He told her about it.</p><p>But, Ira, does not the Duane&#x2019;s Purple ripen too soon? Aren&#x2019;t those the trees just on the other side of the magnolias?</p><p>No, no, my dear. Those are Prince&#x2019;s Yellow Gage. The Duane&#x2019;s Purple matures in keeping with the George Fourths. I&#x2019;d warrant you about the second week of July. Say about the tenth. I should love to see that skin. Such a fine red cheek on the George Fourths, and maybe dotted with that lilac bloom and yellow specks&#x2014;</p><p>But she was not hearing him, she was weeping. He turned to watch her; he sighed, he put out one big hand and touched the thick gray-yellow braid which weighted on her white-frilled shoulder. It was either Moses or Sutherland whom she considered now. Dully he wondered which one.</p><p>She said, on receiving the communication of his thought, though he had said nothing&#x2014; She spoke Suthy&#x2019;s name.</p><p>Oh, said Ira. I said nothing to make you think&#x2014;</p><p>The Prince&#x2019;s Yellow Gage. He fancied them so. When they were still green he&#x2019;d hide them in the little waist he wore. Many&#x2019;s the time I gave him a belting&#x2014;</p><p>She sobbed a while longer, and he stared into the gloom beyond the bed curtains, and did his best to forget Suthy. Suthy was the eldest. Sixteenth Georgia. It was away up at the North, at a place no one had ever heard of before, a place called Gettysburg.</p><p>In recent awareness of bereavement had lain the germ of retreat and restlessness, perhaps; but sometimes Ira spirited himself off into the woods when he was fleeing from no sadness or perplexity. He had gone like that since he could first remember. Oh, pines were taller forty-five years ago&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when he was only three feet tall, the easy nodding grace of their foliage was reared out of all proportion, thirty times his stature. And forests were wilder, forty-five years ago, over in Liberty County, and he went armed with a wooden gun which old Jehu had carved and painted as a Christmas gift for him. It had a real lock, a real flint; it snapped and the sparks flew. Ira Claffey slew brigades of redcoats with this weapon; he went as commander of a force of small blacks; he was their general.</p><p>Hi, them&#x2019;s British, Mastah Iry.</p><p>Where?</p><p>Yonder in them &#x2019;simmons!</p><p>Take them on the flank.</p><p>Hi, what you say we do, Mastah?</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t quite sure what he wanted them to do. Something about the flank. His Uncle Sutherland talked about a flank attack in some wild distant spot known as the Carolinas.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Of course this was later on, perhaps only forty years ago, when Ira Claffey was ten.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Charge those redcoats! They advanced upon the persimmon brake in full cry and leaping; and once there came terror when a doe soared out of the thicket directly in their faces, and all the little darkies scattered like quail, and Ira came near to legging it after them.</p><p>In similar shades he had been Francis Marion, and surely his own boys had scuttled here in identical pursuits. It was a good place to be, treading alone on the clay-paved path curving its way to the closest branch of Sweetwater Creek. God walked ahead and behind and with him, near, powerful, silent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer.</i></p><p>He had budded the peach upon the plum as he wished to do, though he feared that it was a trifle too late in the season for success. He budded each of the two selected trees five times, and then went back to the potato field. Coffee and Jem were doing well enough, but they were plagu�d slow; Ira had been emphatic about the tenderness he required of them, and they handled the big sulphur-colored Brimstones as if they were eggs. Well, he thought, I shan&#x2019;t speed them on this. Better forty bushels well-dug and well-stored than eighty bushels bumped and scratched and ready to spoil as soon as they&#x2019;re covered.</p><p>Keep on with it until I return, and mind about no bruising. I shall look up some pine straw&#x2014;where it&#x2019;s thickest and easy to scoop&#x2014;and we&#x2019;ll fetch the cart after the nooning.</p><p>Yassah.</p><p>Frost had not yet killed the vines. Some planters always waited for a killing frost before they dug, but Ira was certain that the crop kept better if dug immediately before the frost struck.</p><p>He was newly come into his fifty-first year; the natal day had been observed on October sixth. Black Naomi chuckled mysteriously in the kitchen; there had been much talk about, Mistess, can I please speak with you a minute <i>alone</i>? He had to pretend that he was blind and deaf, and owned no suspicion that delicate and hard-to-come-by substances were being lavished in his honor. The fragrant Lady Baltimore cake appeared in time, borne by Ira Claffey&#x2019;s daughter because she would not trust the wenches with this treasure.</p><p>There they sat, the three surviving Claffeys left at home, sipping their roast-grain coffee and speaking words in praise of the cake, and now Ira had lived for half a century&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fifty years stuffed with woe and work and dreams and peril. He sought to dwell in recollection only on the benefits accruing. With Veronica and Lucy he tried to keep his imaginings away from far-off roads where horses and men were in tragic operation.</p><p>The best I&#x2019;ve tasted since the Mexican War.</p><p>Poppy, you always say that. About everything.</p><p>Come, come, Lucy. Do I indeed?</p><p>You do, agreed his wife, and gave him her wan smile above the home-dipped candles.</p><p>Yes, sir, chimed in Lucy. It&#x2019;s always the best and the worst and the biggest and all such things, but always dated from that old war.</p><p>After this night, said Ira, I presume that I should date everything from my fiftieth birthday?</p><p>Poppy, love, you don&#x2019;t look even on the outskirts of fifty. Scarcely a shred of gray in your hair.</p><p>Well, my dear, I don&#x2019;t have much hair left to me.</p><p>That&#x2019;s no certain indication of encroaching age. Is it, Mother? Take Colonel Tollis. I declare, he can&#x2019;t be aged over thirty-one or two, and yet he&#x2019;s got less hair than&#x2014;</p><p>Lucy. Do you consider it ladylike, to discuss baldness so&#x2014;so intimately?</p><p>Well, I declare&#x2014;</p><p>So it had gone; they uttered their little jests and remonstrances; they had their affection; the stringy candles sank and died in chipped gilt candelabra, and in the end Ira Claffey sat alone in his library and treated himself to port. He had tasted no port since the previous winter (there was so little of it left now) and he made a silent gesture and toasted each of his sons in turn as they stared from ambrotype frames beside him. His hand went down and rubbed along his right leg; it caressed his shabby fawn-colored pantaloons above the knotted hole which for years he had bandaged afresh each day. I&#x2019;d be with you, fifty or no fifty, he tried to tell his sons, reaching to them across uncharted distances and dimensions. I&#x2019;d be among the muskets if it hadn&#x2019;t been for Monterey. I wonder who that Mexican was! I wonder if he is living still&#x2014;sorrowing as I am sorrowing, going through repeated and sometimes doleful mimicry. Still able to love, however? Not so frequently? But still able, and most eager at times.</p><p>The wine affected Ira Claffey because he drank so little of it in this time of strife and paucity. He thought of Veronica and the fever which came over him sometimes in darkness, the drawing up of her nightdress, the muffled hysteria of their encounter, the shame which she always admitted afterward because she had been taught that carnal enjoyment was lewd and Ira could never persuade her otherwise. He thought of the mistress he had had in Milledgeville when he was in the Legislature, he thought of pretty strumpets he&#x2019;d known in the brief time when he was a soldier, he thought of the first brown girl he ever lay with at seventeen or thereabouts in age.</p><p>How do you countenance such goings-on? You, professedly a religious man&#x2014;</p><p>I suppose each of us must be guilty of certain sins. We&#x2019;d be less than human if we weren&#x2019;t blemished a bit. And I strive earnestly not to envy, not to grow little snips and slips and buds and seeds of jealousy. I deplore cruelty, and own no avarice&#x2014;at least none I&#x2019;m conscious of. But lust&#x2014;</p><p>I&#x2019;m steeped in that particular brand of iniquity. At least&#x2014;when I was younger&#x2014; And now, now, tonight, the night I&#x2019;m fifty&#x2014;</p><p>Silently he opened the library door and looked across the dark hall. Lucy and her mother were scraping lint at the big table in the crowded parlor; they had a servant helping them, but Lucy was yawning. He felt a fire as he saw that yawn. Soon, then&#x2014; To bed, to bed! Incestuous sheets, sweet prince? Nay, my Veronica and I lie within the embrace of a mortal primness known as Holy Wedlock.</p><p>Thus we contrived eight children, and thus the four small graves within the red rusty fence&#x2014;the longest no longer than my walking stick&#x2014; Thus we had four children to grow to full stature&#x2014;or close to it&#x2014; Thus we came to another war.</p><p>I was a Stephens man from the first, but what possible difference can that make now, to Mr. Stephens or to me?</p><p>I was no Secessionist. Quite the contrary. But dress yourselves in gray, Suthy and Badger and Moses, and be off with your shooting-irons. Scrape the raw white fabric, Lucy. Put up the calves-foot jelly for the wounded, my Veronica. And cry and cry, and read your Bible, and pray again, and cry once more.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Mist had condensed thickly after a chilly night, and Ira walked through it like a swimmer moving erect, walking rapidly though lamely, a man with broad round powerful shoulders, and carrying his head tipped forward as if to resist the weight of the flat-brimmed black hat pulled low on his forehead. His brow was channeled horizontally by four distinct wrinkles like deep narrow scars. His pale eyes shone from a covert of long dark lashes and coffee-colored eyebrows. His nose was insignificant, his wide full-lipped mouth the best feature in a round smooth face. Ira Claffey demonstrated the manner of a keen-eyed hunter who was forever on the watch for birds and expected that a covey would go crackling up and out, only a few steps ahead.</p><p>He would have been able to name the week&#x2014;and possibly the day&#x2014;of the year; he would have been able to name it by evidence before him if startled quickly awake from a century&#x2019;s repose. The long-leaved pines themselves, their banks of dark green plush in milky distance, with the outer tips of pine needles touched by autumnal tan, and yet this tan was invisible until you came close. Sunflowers, the little susie flowers still blooming spiritedly; sodden cornfields shrunken merciless, every ragged stalk of fodder soaked with mist; sandy, clayey bare spots in yard and gardens standing out silvery&#x2014;intense spots, never casual, but seeming to have been cleared and stamped recently, and for a special purpose&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. eight o&#x2019;clock in the morning, as told by his silver watch, with the sun burning low and solid in a cloudless sky but with farthermost groves still fogged; jack-oaks half green and looking withered and scrofulous; the scrub swamp gums well turned at this date, and some of them burning in artificial pinks; tulip trees half green; some of the buttonwoods verdant as in summer.</p><p>The air hung clammy, but still good because it was wild, unprovoked by many men or their machines or structures. Ira heard the squeal of a train whistle (the service was untidy and uncertain on this Southwestern line from Macon to Americus and Albany. Claffey could not have told you with accuracy just how many trains jounced puffing up and down the line each day; at least he knew that the service was sadly confused because of military necessity) and far above the hill and western pines there frothed some woodsmoke as the cars halted at Anderson Station. Nothing much there except a wretched store, several houses, and a pyramid of old sawdust from Yeoman&#x2019;s mill, no longer operating.</p></p><h2>Business Statistics for Management and Economics</h2><p>Business Statistics for Management and Economics is an application-oriented text providing students with a solid grounding in statistical theory and allowing them to make the most of data analysis techniques.

His writings on moral quandaries reflect a lifelong devotion to music and performance, and, as a counterpoint, he wrote on music aesthetics and on modernist composers such as Faur�, Debussy, and Ravel. <i>Music and the Ineffable</i> brings together these two threads, the philosophical and the musical, as an extraordinary quintessence of his thought. Jank�l�vitch deals with classical issues in the philosophy of music, including metaphysics and ontology. These are a point of departure for a sustained examination and dismantling of the idea of musical hermeneutics in its conventional sense.</p><br><p> Music, Jank�l�vitch argues, is not a hieroglyph, not a language or sign system; nor does it express emotions, depict landscapes or cultures, or narrate. On the other hand, music cannot be imprisoned within the icy, morbid notion of pure structure or autonomous discourse. Yet if musical works are not a cipher awaiting the decoder, music is nonetheless entwined with human experience, and with the physical, material reality of music in performance. Music is "ineffable," as Jank�l�vitch puts it, because it cannot be pinned down, and has a capacity to engender limitless resonance in several domains. Jank�l�vitch's singular work on music was central to such figures as Roland Barthes and Catherine Cl�ment, and the complex textures and rhythms of his lyrical prose sound a unique note, until recently seldom heard outside the francophone world.</p></p><p><p>"Imagine! A philosopher who meditates on listening to music, not its ontology; who does not cast composers as heroes and villains; who does not expect music to prophesy the future, or tell us how to live, or solve our political problems; who is allergic to gassy Teutonic grandiloquence (indeed, to Germans tout court).

Employing the same exacting word-for-word approach as the ASV, a world-class team of conservative translators and scholars drew on the strengths of its predecessor and on new Hebrew and Greek textual sources to produce an all-new translation. The New American Standard Bible (NASB) was released in its entirety in 1971, and was updated in 1995 to render it more understandable to modern-English readers. It is recognized as today's most accurate word-for-word translation.<br> <br> Thousands of in-text application notes will enrich your understanding of the biblical text and show how it relates to what God is doing in your life now.

Here a Celtic scholar takes us beyond Stonehenge in a new edition of a classic work about one of history&#39;s most intriguing and influential cultures. 3 maps. photos.</p><p></p><h2>Classics of Philosophy</h2><p><em>Classics of Philosophy</em> is the most comprehensive anthology of writings in western philosophy in print. Spanning 2,500 years of thought, it is ideal for introduction to philosophy and history of philosophy courses. Over seventy-five works by forty-two philosophers as well as fragments from the Pre-Socratics are included, offering students and general readers alike an extensive and economical collection of the major works of the western tradition. <br> This anthology contains the most important writings from Thales to Rawls; twenty-four of these are complete works, including such classics as Plato's <em>Republic</em>, Descartes' <em>Meditations on First Philosophy</em>, Leibniz's <em>The Monadology</em>, Hume's <em>An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</em>, Kant's <em>Foundation</em> <em>for the Metaphysic of Morals</em>, Mill's <em>Utilitarianism</em>, Russell's <em>The Problems of Philosophy</em>, Sartre's <em>Existentialism and Humanism</em>, and Rawls's "Justice as Fairness," while the others are judiciously abridged so that little of value to the student is lost. The book provides a broad view of the most significant stages of growth in western philosophy, including its birth with the Pre-Socratics as well as its contemporary developments. A lucid introduction, including a brief biographical sketch, accompanies each of the featured philosophers. <br> <em>Classics of Philosophy</em> is available in this single-volume edition and in two split volumes. <em>Volume I: Ancient and Medieval</em> covers philosophers from the Pre-Socratics to William of Ockham; and <em>Volume II: Modern and Contemporary</em> begins with Descartes and ends with Rawls.</p><p><br>Louis P.

It includes excerpts from recently published pieces that use various sociological perspectives, especially critical frameworks, to examine a wide range of topics-from the globalization of hazardous wastes and industries to mountaintop removal for mining to the construction of nature in a television sitcom. This second edition, like the first, aims to engage undergraduate students, and includes nine new selections chosen from recent work. A section on social constructionism has been added, and the section on science, risk, and health has been expanded to mirror the increased interest in that field. The new edition also includes a chapter on climate change and new selections in the section on &#39;Thinking about Change/Working for Change,&#39; which helps students see how individuals can affect the future of the planet through their actions.</p><p>Leslie King is assistant professor of sociology and environmental science and policy at Smith College. Deborah McCarthy is assistant professor in sociology and anthropology at the College of Charleston.This collection of contemporary works is organized around the premise that environmental decline has sociological dimensions. Social and political institutions have environmental impacts that must be properly understood if humans want to reverse environmental degradation. Woven throughout is the central contention that environmental decision making is dependent on systems of power relations or individual levels of power. (G. B.

Using a variety of scientific techniques, Duccio Bonavia explores the development of maize, its adaptation to varying climates, and its fundamental role in ancient American cultures. An appendix (by Alexander Grobman) provides the first ever comprehensive compilation of maize genetic data, correlating this data with the archaeological evidence presented throughout the book. This book provides a unique interpretation of questions of dating and evolution, supported by extensive data, following the spread of maize from South to North America, and eventually to Europe and beyond.</p><p>This book examines one of the thorniest problems of ancient American archaeology: the origins and domestication of maize.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Willard Van Orman Quine begins this influential work by declaring, &#34;Language is a social art. In acquiring it we have to depend entirely on intersubjectively available cues as to what to say and when.&#34; With &#34;Word and Object&#34; Quine challenged the tradition of conceptual analysis as a way of advancing knowledge. The book signaled twentieth-century philosophy&#39;s turn away from metaphysics and what has been called the &#34;phony precision&#34; of conceptual analysis. In the course of his discussion of meaning and the linguistic mechanisms of objective reference, Quine considers the indeterminacy of translation, brings to light the anomalies and conflicts implicit in our language&#39;s referential apparatus, clarifies semantic problems connected with the imputation of existence, and marshals reasons for admitting or repudiating each of various categories of supposed objects. A profoundly influential work.</p><p>Language consists of dispositions, socially instilled, to respond observably to socially observable stimuli. Such is the point of view from which a noted philosopher and logician examines the notion of meaning and the linguistic mechanisms of objective reference. In the course of the discussion, Professor Quine pinpoints the difficulties involved in translation, brings to light the anomalies and conflicts implicit in our language&#39;s referential apparatus, clarifies semantic problems connected with the imputation of existence, and marshals reasons for admitting or repudiating each of various categories of supposed objects.Willard Van Orman Quine (1908--2000) held the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy at Harvard University from 1956 to 2000. Considered one the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century, he is the author of <i>Mathematical Logic, The Roots of Reference, The Time of My Life: An Autobiography</i> (MIT Press), and many other books.</p><h2>Contacts Desired: Gay and Lesbian Communications and Community, 1940s-1970s</h2><p><p>Whether one thinks homosexuals are born or made, they generally are not born into gay families, nor are they socialized to be gay by their peers or schools. How then do people become aware of homosexuality and, in some cases, integrate into gay communities? The making of homosexual identity is the result of a communicative process that entails searching, listening, looking, reading, and finding. <i>Contacts Desired</i> proposes that this communicative process has a history, and it sets out to tell that story.<br> <br> Martin Meeker here argues that over the course of the twentieth century, a series of important innovations occurred in the networks that linked individuals to a larger social knowledge of homosexuality. He points to three key innovations in particular: the emergence of the homophile movement in the 1950s; the mass media treatments of homosexuals in the late 1950s and early 1960s; and the popularization of do-it-yourself publishing from the late 1940s to the 1970s, which offered bar guides, handmade magazines, and other materials that gay men and lesbians could use to seek one another out. In the process, Meeker unearths a treasure trove of archival materials that reveals how homosexuals played a crucial role in transforming the very structure of communications and urban communities since the postwar era.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p><p>"<i>Contacts Desired</i> is a valuable and enduring work of scholarship, surely the best book in gay and lesbian history this year."--<i>Gay and Lesbian Review</i></p> <p></p> <p> </p></p><p><b>Martin Meeker</b> is a historian at the Regional Oral History Office of the University of California, Berkeley.<br>&#34;Martin Meeker&#39;s vivid account of the first gay guidebooks, newspapers, and publishing companies and of how early activists worked to change the mass media&#39;s representation of gay life provides an innovative new framework for analyzing the early gay movement and helps explain how San Francisco became the promised land to so many lesbians and gay men.

Only my eyes are visible, and I blow bubbles to ensure the rest of me stays submerged until the opportune time. Besides the lifeguard watching from his perch, there&#x2019;s a gaggle of girls my age patrolling the beach with younger siblings in tow. They pace in their flip-flops and bikinis, and I wait.<br> <br>The ideal time is when no one&#x2019;s around and no one&#x2019;s looking. But right now there&#x2019;s a little girl cross-legged on wooden bleachers peering at me from beneath a hand held aloft at her forehead, a smile on her face. I can&#x2019;t tell if the smile is a result of how long she&#x2019;s been watching me bob here in the water.<br> <br>To check whether she&#x2019;s staring, I test her with a long gaze to the left of the bleachers, where Dad and his wife Linda are barbecuing. Their oldest son, Logan, round and berry-brown from a day in the sun, is digging a hole nearby, while the newest addition, Luke, lies on a quilt wearing a swim diaper.<br> <br>Dad said I&#x2019;d love it here because the beachfront cottage they&#x2019;d rented was one of the only two Cherie and Ed had let out this weekend. Secluded. Serene. Safe.<br> <br>Ha. Cherie and Ed forgot to mention that the beach portion doesn&#x2019;t actually belong to them and is public property at all hours of the day. Party central.<br> <br>I look back, and, hallelujah, the girl on the bleachers is gone. There&#x2019;s also a lull on the shore now. The lifeguard&#x2019;s turned to talk to someone behind him, and the beach girls are on the far right, peering at a sand castle.<br> <br>I stand and cringe at the sucking sound as my swimsuit sticks to me, all four yards of the spandex-Lycra blend of it. Waterfalls gush out of the many hems on the outfit, and, as I hobble out of the lake, more secret pockets release their water. I&#x2019;m a drippy, squelchy mess, stumbling toward Dad and Linda, picking up tons of sand as I move. I refuse to look around in case I see someone, everyone, watching me.<br> <br>Maybe my face reveals something, because Dad starts right away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Janna, why do you have to wear that thing? You could have said, No, I&#x2019;m not wearing your burkini, Mom.&#x201d; He waves around long tongs as he speaks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom didn&#x2019;t get it for me.

They also seem to feel entitled to every advantage and unwilling to make the leap into adulthood. As Polly Young-Eisendrath makes clear in this brilliant account of where a generation has gone astray, parents trying to make their children feel special are unwittingly interfering with their kids&#39; ability to accept themselves and cope with life. Clarifying an enormous cultural change, THE SELF-ESTEEM TRAP shows why so many young people have trouble with empathy and compassion, struggle with moral values, and are stymied in the face of adversity. Young-Eisendrath offers prescriptive advice on how adults can help kids--through the teen and young adult years--develop self-worth, setting them on the right track to productive, balanced, and happy lives.</p><p>Polly Young-Eisendrath, a psychologist and Jungian analyst, is the author of 13 books (translated into 20 languages), including <em>The Resilient Spirit</em> and <em>Women and Desire</em>. She lives and practices near Montpelier, Vermont.Young-Eisendrath, a Vermont-based Jungian analyst, practicing Buddhist and author (<i>Women and Desire</i>), identifies a threatening and perplexing problem she calls the self-esteem trap. Today's children and young adults are suffering from a number of symptoms, including obsessive self-focus, restless dissatisfaction, pressures to be exceptional, unreadiness to accept responsibilities and feelings of either superiority or inferiority. According to the author, instead of contentment and positive self-regard, kids raised to believe they are extraordinary or special are more likely to be unhappy and disappointed. Being ordinary and realizing one's connection to the human community is the real key to happiness, she argues, and cultivating the qualities of generosity, discipline, patience, diligence, concentration and wisdom will lead to children who are self-confident and content. She also warns against parents who run interference, protecting their children from inevitable disappointments. Instead, letting kids develop autonomy and experience the consequences of their decisions, she claims, is the way to go. At times, Young-Eisendrath's scope seems unwieldy, but her message rings true. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Giroux tells why Eisenhower saw the academy as part of the famous complex - and how his warning was vitally prescient for 21st-century America. Giroux details the sweeping post-9/11 assault being waged on the academy by militarization, corporatization, and right-wing fundamentalists who increasingly view critical thought itself as a threat to the dominant political order. Giroux argues that the university has become a handmaiden of the Pentagon and corporate interests, it has lost its claim to independence and critical learning and has compromised its role as a democratic public sphere. And yet, in spite of its present embattled status and the inroads made by corporate power, the defense industries, and the right wing extremists, Giroux defends the university as one of the few public spaces left capable of raising important questions and educating students to be critical and engaged agents. He concludes by making a strong case for reclaiming it as a democratic public sphere.</p><p><b>Henry A. Giroux</b> currently holds the Global TV Network Chair Professorship at McMaster University in the English and Cultural Studies Department. He has published numerous books and articles and his most recent books include <i>America&#x2019;s Educational Deficit and the War on Youth</i> (2013) and <i>Neoliberalism&#x2019;s War on Higher Education</i> (2014). <b>The Toronto Star has named Henry Giroux one of the twelve Canadians changing the way we think! Read the article here: </b>Twelve Canadians Changing the Way We Think&#x201c;I know of no more acute a commentator on higher education in the United States today.

[The book] provides crucial insights and an antidote to the state of universities today that those concerned with human rights, anti-war, critical pedagogy, and freedom of critical thought and higher education will find of great value. Giroux&#x2019;s brilliant design of the book, from the development of corporate universities to the relationship between military and academia, ends not in hopelessness, but in a call to break the chains of these dominating industrial complexes, and to proclaim that the protection of academia is the most important battle that students, faculty, and staff must unite together to fight for!&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Political Media Review <br> <br>&#x201c;The University in Chains should be essential reading for everyone inside and outside the academy concerned with the increasing and foreboding militarization of the world,... Giroux&#x2019;s call for a pedagogy of critical conviction, political engagement and social intervention is imperative in the continuing struggle to overcome practical politics powerlessness, reclaim public space as a democratic sphere, and break the chain of injustice and oppression.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Scott D. Morris, College of Education and Technology at Eastern New Mexico University, in Dissident Voice <br> <br>&#x201c;Henry A. Giroux has done it again. In his usual passionate and inspiring mode of intensive scrutiny, theoretical engagement, and faith in the future of social change, he has diagnosed, diagrammed, and interrogated a glaring political problem of our times. ...

In this book, Giroux proves that he is not simply an engaged intellectual, but an intellectual whose work has been dedicated to salvaging the public sphere (that is, the academy) within an inclusive democracy. Giroux urges us to believe that higher education represents one of the most important sites over which the battle for democracy is being waged.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Sheila L.

To challenge it is one of our few remaining taboos. In this pathbreaking and superbly written book, philosopher Simon May does just that, dissecting our resilient ruling ideas of love and showing how they are the product of a long and powerful cultural heritage.</p><p>Tracing over 2,500 years of human thought and history, May shows how our ideal of love developed from its Hebraic and Greek origins alongside Christianity until, during the last two centuries, "God is love" became "love is God"&#x2014;so hubristic, so escapist, so untruthful to the real nature of love, that it has booby-trapped relationships everywhere with deluded expectations. Brilliantly, May explores the very different philosophers and writers, both skeptics and believers, who dared to think differently: from Aristotle's perfect friendship and Ovid's celebration of sex and "the chase," to Rousseau's personal authenticity, Nietzsche's affirmation, Freud's concepts of loss and mourning, and boredom in Proust. Against our belief that love is an all-powerful solution to finding meaning, security, and happiness in life, May reveals with great clarity what love actually is: the intense desire for someone whom we believe can ground and affirm our very existence. The feeling that "makes the world go round" turns out to be a harbinger of home--and in that sense, of the sacred.</p></p><p><b>Simon May</b> is visiting professor of philosophy at King's College London, and Birkbeck, University of London."May could just have achieved the seemingly impossible and produced a truly original philosophy of love...

G. F. and J. Rivington, London 1841. This edition is bound in leather, has 2,832 pages and each volume is 6" x 8.25" </p><p>Imagine a round-table discussion of the Gospels among the supreme theologians of the Church. The <i>Catena Aurea</i> is very close! St. Thomas Aquinas compiled this opus from sermons and commentaries on the Gospels written by the early Church Fathers, arranging their thoughts in such a way that they form a continuous commentary on each Gospel. For each of the four Gospel writers, the <i>Catena Aurea</i> starts by indicating the verses to be analyzed, then taking each verse phrase-by-phrase, provides the early Fathers insights into the passage. </p><p>St. Thomas Aquinas' <i>Catena Aurea</i> is a masterpiece anthology of Patristic commentary on the Gospels it includes the work of over eighty Church Fathers. </p><p>St. Thomas Aquinas work demonstrates intimate acquaintance with the Church Fathers and is an excellent complement to the more recent attempts to understand the inner meaning of the Sacred Scriptures. For each of the four Gospel writers, the <i>Catena Aurea</i> starts by indicating the verses to be analyzed, then phrase-by-phrase, provides the early Fathers insights into the passage. </p><p>The unchanging rule of the Church is that no one [is] to interpret the Sacred Scripture... contrary to the unanimous consent of the Fathers (Vatican I). Just as in our own day there has been renewed interest in the Church Fathers, so in the 13th century, when the Catena Aurea was compiled, the western church was undergoing a similar revival of interest in the ancient patristic authors and the works of many Eastern Fathers were translated from Greek to Latin for the first time. During this period there was increasing hunger for the true and authentic interpretation of Scripture, which the Church Fathers hold the key to. </p><p>St. Thomas Aquinas was commissioned to write the <i>Catena Aurea</i> by Pope Urban IV, in order that an orthodox Patristic commentary on the Gospels was readily available to all readers. John Henry Newman, who is widely expected to be canonized next year, was responsible for its translation into English in 1841. Cardinal Newman hoped that the <i>Catena Aurea</i> would become a source of catechesis within the family and the Church. Cardinal Newman s edition of the <i>Catena Aurea</i> is one of the jewels of the 19th century Catholic Restoration, making the scholarship of the Fathers available to a wider audience. As with many 19th century texts it employs a sober, dignified style of English, which is eminently suitable to the unsurpassable mysteries of the Catholic Faith. </p><p>The <i>Catena Aurea</i>, compiled by one of the Catholic Church s greatest minds, is of immeasurable use to priests writing homilies, lay people engaged in private or family study or of the Gospels and religious instructors will find it an invaluable help in preparing lessons. It is the perfect companion to study the Scriptures in detail and receive the wisdom of St. Thomas on particular passages. </p><p>Consider the <i>Catena Aurea</i> as a discussion of the Gospels among the supreme theologians of the Church. Their exegesis is astonishing! A worthy recommendation for the serious student of the Bible is a copy of the only work that Aquinas was known to carry around with him. </p><p>This is the first time in more than 150 years that the English translation of the <i>Catena Aurea</i> has been entirely re-typeset, meaning that the text is crisp, clear and easy to read, unlike many facsimile editions.</p></p><p><p>Thomas Aquinas was born in 1225 in Sicily. He joined the Benedictine abbey of Montecassino at the age of five to begin his studies. At the age of sixteen, he was transferred to the University of Naples, where he became familiar with the revival of Aristotle and the Order of Preachers (the Dominicans). Aquinas continued to study in Cologne in 1244 and Paris in 1245. Returning to Cologne, he became a lecturer in 1248. As a theologian of great renown, he travelled throughout Europe, and when not lecturing or teaching, Aquinas participated in public life and was an advisor to popes and kings. </p><p>Thomas Aquinas died on March 7, 1274, and fifty years after his death, Pope John XXII proclaimed Thomas Aquinas a saint. In 1879, Pope Leo XII made Thomas Aquinas the patron saint of education.</p>Baronius Press have published a newly typeset edition in four volumes of St Thomas Aquinas' Catena Aurea, as translated into English by the Venerable John Henry Newman. I was very excited to receive a copy of this recently. "Catena Aurea" means "golden chain" and the work consists of a running commentary on the four gospels, taken from the Fathers of the Church. It thus provides a sure guide to the spiritual sense of the gospels and the apostolic tradition in relation to their interpretation. The intrinsic quality of the work is remarkable: the theological genius of St Thomas Aquinas is applied to the selection of quotations from the Fathers, and summaries of their teaching. He was commissioned to compile the commentary by Pope Urban IV. There could scarcely be a better translator than Newman, a highly competent classicist in his own right, and a master of the use of the English language. In his preface to the 1841 edition, Newman wrote: "[...] it is impossible to read the Catena of S. Thomas, without being struck with the masterly and architectonic skill with which it is put together. A learning of the highest kind, not a mere literary book-knowledge, which might have supplied the place of indexes and tables in ages destitute of those helps, and when every thing was to be read in unarranged and fragmentary MSS. but a thorough acquaintance with the whole range of ecclesiastical antiquity, so as to be able to bring the substance of all that had been written on any point to bear upon the text which involved it a familiarity with the style of each writer, so as to compress into few words the pith of a whole page, and a power of clear and orderly arrangement in this mass of knowledge, are qualities which make this Catena perhaps nearly perfect as a conspectus of Patristic interpretation. Other compilations exhibit research, industry, learning; but this, though a mere compilation, evinces a masterly command over the whole subject of Theology." Although the text has been entirely reset, Baronius have take great care to ensure that the new edition is in continuity with the original edition published by John Henry Parker (Oxford) &amp; J. G. F. and J. Rivington (London) in 1841. They have followed the page numbers of the older edition so that page references may be easily found, and have reproduced the typographical character of the original. The four volumes are leather bound, with two ribbon markers for each volume, gold blocking and marbled endpapers. This is a beautiful and high quality set. It would make a welcome gift for a priest or seminarian, and a fine addition to any home as a guide to the text of the gospels. --Fr. Tim Finigan, book review of Divine Intimacy posted on his blog "Hermeneutic of Continuity" on December 21, 2009<br><br>Since all knowledge begins with the senses, we should start with this: the newly typeset edition of St. Thomas Catena Aurea is absolutely beautiful. Leather-bound and sturdy, with ribbons and gilded page edges, this four-volume set will last the test of time and look good doing it. The binding is tight, the books stay open, and the page numbering matches with the 1841 edition, all of which is consistent with the quality we would expect from Baronius Press. But the contents of the Catena are even more sublime than its binding. In the Golden Chain, St. Thomas has collected and ordered the best of the Gospel commentaries of the Church Fathers into a unified whole. Each passage of scripture, set in larger type, is followed, phrase by phrase, by the interpretations and reflections of the Fathers. Like the Summa Theologiae, the Catena is a synthesis of all that came before, to which the wisdom of St. Thomas brings order and form. The comments he has selected invite us to deeper prayer and contemplation, and can be a wonderful resource for lectio divina. --Bro. Philip Neri Reese OP, from Dominicana, Journal of the Dominican Students of the Province of St. Joseph (Vol LX, No. 1, Spring 2011)<br><br>These bound volumes are a pleasure to hold and read from. The easily lay open flat on a table, not matter which page one is on. Each hardback volume, which measures out at 6"x 8.25", is bound in leather, including fine marbled endpapers. As many of you know, I had my Knox edition rebound last year. It took me a few months to finally pull the trigger on it since I really liked the leather hardback. However, one of the things I liked most were the marble endpapers in the Knox. Even to this day, I sneak a peak at my goatskin Knox almost wishing to see those lovely endpapers. Oh well! I won't be having this set rebound! Each volume has a sturdy sewn binding and the pages are gold gilded. Again, and like almost everything Baronius does, when you read from these volumes, you know that you are reading from a book that has been lovingly produced. Baronius does not do things on the cheap. Yes, you will have to pay a bit more for their products, but they are absolutely worth the price. We need more Catholic publishers who are committed to producing high-quality Bibles, missals, and other books. Finally, a nice addition to each volume is the inclusion of two ribbons. The Catena is, of course, available in various digital sources, including some of the Bible software products that are out there. However, if you like to have a beautifully made hardbound edition, Baronius Press has the set for you. --Timothy McCormick, Catholic Bibles Blog, June 2014</p><h2>The Poisoned Well: New Strategies For Groundwater Protection</h2><p><i>The Poisoned Well</i> offers vital strategies for citizens, community organizations, and public officials who want to fight the battle against pollutants.</p><p>Of all freshwater in the U.S., "96 percent is groundwater." In 1984, OTA (Office of Technology Assessment) listed more than "200 contaminants known to occur in groundwater." Today the list is "over three times larger." This manual gives step-by-step guidance to concerned citizens on protecting groundwater resources; it brings together information from multiple federal agencies with responsibilities in this area and gives basic outline-guidance for more local operations. This book is important as the first comprehensive, lay guide to how groundwater works; the health problems associated with contamination; how to test and monitor water supplies; and how to take action as a citizen against polluters. Easy to understand and well documented, this is recommended for public and university libraries.<br><i>- Diane M.

Through the brilliant photographs of Mal Warshaw, &#34;To Live Until We Say Good-Bye&#34; gives a gripping, intimate view of Dr. Kubler-Ross&#39;s counseling work with terminally ill patients as she brings them to an acceptance of death.</p><p><b>Elisabeth K�bler-Ross, M.D.,</b> is a medical doctor, psychiatrist, and internationally renowned thanatologist. Her books include <i>The Wheel of Life,</i> the classic <i>On Death and Dying, AIDS,</i> and <i>Questions and Answers on Death and Dying.</i><p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>Beth</b> </p><p> Beth, the first of our friends in this book, was a most remarkable and beautiful woman -- both in terms of her outward appearance and her inner sensibilities. She was 42 years old when we met her and had been full of cancer for a couple of years. Pictures of a few years earlier revealed an outstandingly handsome woman, who had been a model in New York. </p><p> Her appearance was impeccable, and therefore, the cancer was a devastating intrusion, not only because of its ultimate fatal outcome, but because of the effect it had on the looks of a pretty young woman for whom appearance was of the utmost significance. </p><p> Childless, but surrounded by friends, she sought help from the best medical centers. She finally had surgery in Europe and returned to New York hoping for a little more time. Toni, her best friend and confidante, was her main support system. Lucy Kroll, her friend and neighbor, introduced Beth to us; the result was an all too brief but deeply moving relationship. </p><p> She managed to stay at home as long as possible, taking care of her own environment and medication without the help of a nurse. During the three months that we knew her, she had already stopped eating regular meals, was sustained by a food formula. She finally signed herself into the hospital just a couple weeks prior to her death. </p><p> Beth was also a poet and philosopher; she had spent many hours at the foot of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument on Riverside Drive near her apartment. It was a place surrounded by greenery, a place to think, reflect, and meditate, but also a place to be reminded of the transitions of life and the risks of life. It was a meeting place for young lovers and old people. It was not a coincidence that Beth chose this very place, which had been so meaningful in her life, as the place where she wanted her ashes spread after her cremation. </p><p> What Beth demonstrated to us is that when human beings have the courage to face their own finiteness and come to grips with that deepest agony, questioning, turmoil, and pain -- they emerge as new people. They begin to converse with God, or the Source, or whatever you want to call it, and a new kind of existence begins for them. We have seen this in countless cases. These patients often become poets; they become creative beyond any expectations, far beyond what their educational backgrounds had prepared them for. </p><p> This process is exemplified in Beth by some of the thoughts that demonstrate the kind of person she became. </p><p> It is so nice to go out and walk in the sunshine, it just feels good to be alive and aware.<br> I have an appointment with my hairdresser and a cancer specialist. I know that my hairdresser will make me feel better. I am not so sure about the cancer specialist.<br> If my life is a gift, why can't I spend it as I please?<br> Death is staring too long into the burning sun and the relief of entering a cool, dark room. </p><p> She expressed belief that only real feelings can be shared and not words alone when she wrote: </p><p> Some people read what I write, they <i>think</i> they know me. Some people feel what I write, they <i>do.</i> </p><p> The reason for all this emerging creativity in patients like Beth is the fact that we all have many hidden gifts within our own being, and they are all too frequently drowned in the negative and materialistic struggles on which we spend so much of our precious energy. Once we are able to get rid of our fears, once we have the courage to change from negative rebellion to positive nonconformism, once we have the faith in our own abilities to rise above fear, shame, guilt and negativity -- we emerge as much more creative and much freer souls. </p><p> When Beth's abdomen blew up and she looked like a pregnant woman, she did not brood about never having had a child. She picked a loose and colorful dress, put her hair up in a big knot over her head, added cosmetics to enhance her features. She looked pretty to the last day of her life. She always remained immaculate, contradicting the popular belief that all cancer patients have to look and smell bad. She was not too proud to admit that there were a few pleasures in life she was not able to give up -- like smoking a cigarette. She never had to pretend to be other than she was. She never hid her true feelings about anything. She never had to be ashamed or guilty that she had played a game at the end of her life to conform to the needs of other people rather than to her own. </p><p> The kind of person Beth was is perhaps best illustrated in her own world of dreams and longing for a love that is rarely found. </p><p> You put your arms around me, held me tight and close to you and said, "If it be true you don't have long to live then every moment of every hour let's live them together. I love you and wanted to spend my growing old years with you but if you must leave me I shall remember you as something special I had for a little while." </p><p> That's the way it could have been. </p><p> When it was time for me to come home from the hospital you were so eager you were much too early. You waited with your arms full of lilacs, gave me your special smile and said, "I've come to take you home, my darling, now my life can begin anew." </p><p> That's the way it could have been. </p><p> We used to go out together every night but now I get tired so easily and would waken early to enjoy the long, beautiful summer mornings. You said, "Going out is empty to me without you by my side." So we would lie in bed side-by-side, holding hands, not saying much but sharing. </p><p> That's the way it could have been. </p><p> I remember those long early morning walks we took together. We were both filled with a new awareness. We gloried in the smell of grass newly mown. We laughed to think that we had never really listened to the birds singing. Nothing and no one was ugly to us because this was life, and whatever came later, we had realized that what we had together was special and it could never be taken from us. </p><p> That's the way it could have been. </p><p> As the cancer grew within me, my body became misshapen and ugly, but it didn't make any difference to you. You said, "I love what you are and that makes you always beautiful to me." Then I realized how foolish I was and fell asleep with a smile on my face because your love did not waver. </p><p> That's the way it could have been. </p><p> Now when we would walk together my legs would weaken but I knew I would never fall because you were there to hold me. When I would waken in the night screaming with pain you were always there and you would say, "Hold on a moment longer, my love, just a moment longer." </p><p> That's the way it could have been. </p><p> Sometimes I would say to you, "Why don't you go out by yourself or some of your friends?" And you would say, "Now that would be silly for me to do when I've got you to enjoy. I'm afraid life will seem very empty to me when you're gone so I want to fill myself with you now; that way you'll forever live on within me." </p><p> That's the way it could have been. </p><p> Once I was even foolish enough to suggest to you that you should find another woman. You got so angry, you nearly frightened me,but secretly I was pleased too when you said, "You are all I want or need, no other woman no matter how young or how beautiful could give me what just one tender kiss from your lips can give me." </p><p> That's the way it could have been. </p><p> Then came the momentous day, when we learned there was real hope for me. It's funny that's the first time I saw tears in your eyes, but your voice sang when you said to me, "Deep inside I knew you wouldn't be taken from me and it made me strong for you, now my strength will know no bounds, we will fight this battle together my precious one and we will win. Some day we will look back on these nightmare days, your hair will be gray and mine will probably all be gone, but our love will burn as strongly as ever and we will know those times of pain and sorrow were all worthwhile and we still have each other." </p><p> That's the way it could have been. </p><p> It is not important to know what the reality of Beth's life was in terms of the love she had. Most people are unable to understand the true essence of love. Love is not conditional; it has no strings attached to it, no expectations. This is the love that Beth, and those like her, was dreaming of. </p><p> Too few patients experience this kind of love in their lifetime and this is the hardest and yet most important lesson all of us have to learn. Those like Beth help us to get a glimpse of what it could be if we really understood the gift of LOVE. </p><p> Beth believed, no, she <i>knew</i> about the existence of life after death. She talked about her out-of-body experiences and said that death would be the one trip from which she would not return. She talked to her father while close to death herself. </p><p> She also wrote a little personal note to her father shortly before she died: </p><p> Hi, Pop, you have been dead for some time now.<br> Supposedly<br> I guess I know better -- huh?<br> How much longer will you<br> make me wait? </p><p> The last page in her book of poems ends with: </p><p> What can I do with the rest of my life?<br> LIVE ALL OF IT!! </p><p> Yes, Beth, you lived all of it and you have been an example to many of us. We thank you for being, we have been blessed by your existence, and we will remember your last handwritten words which say good-bye to us: </p><p> Voices whispering, Beth, Beth<br> You can no longer stay<br> Hands reaching out to grasp<br> Helping me on my way. </p><p> I'll no longer ache with sorrow<br> No longer feel this pain<br> So adieu and fare thee well now<br> I shan't see thee again. </p><p> <i>[Editor's Note: These poems are from the diaries which Beth kept during the last months of her illness.]</i> </p><p> I used to have<br> Strange visitors<br> In the night<br> They no longer<br> Come to me.<br> I miss them. </p><p> LOVE<br> IS<br> Honeycolored laughter<br> Ambercolored laughter<br> Scarlet swings against a backdrop<br> Of freshly fallen snow. </p><p> It does<br> Strange<br> Things<br> Like<br> Dying. </p><p> If I could remember What I forgot<br> And forget what I remember<br> (with exceptions -- of course)<br> I think<br> It would be better for me<br> But, I'm not sure<br> What to remember...<br> Or forget... </p><p> Humiliation lies in the hands<br> Of a beloved,<br> Of a<br> False friend<br> Better to have the Pride<br> Of aloneness,<br> A defiant end. </p><p> I used to wish for death<br> A lot of the time.<br> Then I died<br> For a little time.<br> Now I wish to die<br> Some of the time.<br> But, now I know<br> It will be<br> For all the time. </p><p> There is a sadness growing Within me<br> I do not want it so, but I know<br> I cry with bitterness Filling me.<br> It does not hurt the way<br> It did<br> Yesterday<br> There is only room for Just so much sorrow.<br> What will I put in Its place<br> Tomorrow? </p><p> Copyright � 1978 by Ross Medical Associates, S.C., and Mal Warshaw</p></p><h2>Home Landscaping: Midwest Region: Including Southern Canada</h2><p><i>Home Landscaping: Midwest Region, Including Southern Canada</i>, shows how to beautify 23 common landscape situations, such as front and back entries, walkways, borders, slopes, and patios. 46 design variations incorporate more than 200 of the best plants for the Midwest.

Kahn offers a philosophical meditation on the problem of evil. He uses the Genesis story of the Fall as the starting point for a profound articulation of the human condition. Kahn shows us that evil expresses the rage of a subject who knows both that he is an image of an infinite God and that he must die. Kahn's interpretation of Genesis leads him to inquiries into a variety of modern forms of evil, including slavery, torture, and genocide.</p><br><p> Kahn takes issue with Hannah Arendt's theory of the banality of evil, arguing that her view is an instance of the modern world's lost capacity to speak of evil. Psychological, social, and political accounts do not explain evil as much as explain it away. Focusing on the existential roots of evil rather than on the occasions for its appearance, Kahn argues that evil originates in man's flight from death. He urges us to see that the opposite of evil is not good, but love: while evil would master death, love would transcend it.</p><br><p> Offering a unique perspective that combines political and cultural theory, law, and philosophy, Kahn here continues his project of advancing a political theology of modernity.</p></p><p><p>"Paul W. Kahn's book is one of the deepest meditations on evil that I have read. It is insightful, rich, and original. Its main merit is the particular existential line of inquiry that it offers--uncovering the root of evil in the human condition itself. It therefore avoids the sort of investigation that is so common concerning evil, which concentrates on the social and political conditions that trigger evil. Kahn weaves this existential inquiry through an interpretation of the Genesis myth of the fall, postulating the source of evil in the human condition of knowledge, shame, and death. It is one of the most compelling modern readings of Genesis that I have encountered."<b>--Moshe Halbertal, Hebrew University, Jerusalem</b></p><p>"<i>Out of Eden</i> is an extraordinary, deeply original reflection on the nature of evil."<b>--David Luban, Georgetown University</b></p><b>Paul W.

She finds that the artists who made California their home in the 1960s did not abandon their paint brushes for tennis rackets and surfboards, but rather created in their works a new and different sense of space, the urban experience, and popular culture.<br><br>Whiting shows how artists such as Vija Celmins, Llyn Foulkes, David Hockney, Dennis Hopper, Allan Kaprow, Claes Oldenburg, Ed Ruscha, and Judy Chicago helped to shape the identity of Los Angeles as an emerging art center, while avoiding in their representation of the city the clich�s of both its boosters and its detractors. Delving deep into the southern California aesthetic sensibility, <i>Pop L.A. </i>recounts how the artists transformed the image of the city in works that focused on the ocean and landscape, suburban life, dilapidated houses in aging neighborhoods, streets and parking lots, and public buildings such as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The common bond of place, for Whiting, gives coherence to the varied experiments in the visual and performance arts that altered the cultural terrain during this pivotal time. The Los Angeles art scene in the 1960s inspired a new generation of architectural writing about the metropolis and its debased sister city, Las Vegas. Over the course of the decade, the conception of the city pioneered by artists in Los Angeles spread beyond the city of angels to characterize cultural life in the United States.</p><p>"<i>Pop L.A.</i> maps the relation between a new urban and cultural space and the artists who confronted it and gave it form. Los Angeles in the 1960s in C�cile Whiting's smart and incisive study was home not only to a zany, outr� popular culture but also to a Pop Art as expansive, crisscrossed, and de-centered as the city's entangled freeways and urban sprawl. Ruscha's photographs of gas stations and parking lots, Hockney's paintings of swimming pools and tract homes, Rodia's Watts Towers, and more--after this book, none will look the same."&#x2014;Anthony W. Lee, Mount Holyoke College, author of <i>Picturing Chinatown</i><br><br>"Sun, surf, sand, sex, strip malls, subdivisions: all are present in C�cile Whiting's trenchant anatomy of <i>Pop Los Angeles</i>. And all were central to the vision artists constructed of this protean city as a site of both pleasure and emptiness, speed and stasis. Some artists, however, went further, not merely representing the city, but intervening in it, and for Whiting, the results&#x2014;whether a performance by Kaprow or a tower by Rodia&#x2014;further demonstrate the wild diversity of a multicentric city that somehow seems both more and less than a circumscribable place."&#x2014;Anne Wagner, author of <i>Mother Stone: The Vitality of Modern British Sculpture</i><br><br>"In <i>Pop L.A.: Art and the City in the 1960s</i>, C�cile Whiting proves herself an expert guide to the cultural and artistic landscape of Los Angeles.

France was surrounded by enemies but fought them off, largely through the achievements of Napoleon Bonaparte, the Republic&#x2019;s youngest general. Within a decade he had become Consul, First Consul, and finally Emperor, creating a new dynasty and a new order in Europe. From 1803 until 1809 he seemed unbeatable, vanquishing his foes one after another, but his invasion of Russia in 1812 proved disastrous and he faced a growing coalition of enemy powers. His defeat at the Battle of Waterloo marked the close of the Napoleonic era, but not the end of the Napoleonic legend. This book charts Napoleon&#x2019;s rise and fall and analyses the weaponry and rival armies that were to transform 19th Century Europe.</p><p>From humble Corsican origins, Napoleon Bonaparte came to stand alongside the most recognizable figures of history. His achievements place him among he greatest captains in history - military geniuses such as Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. To most French people he is the great hero who steered France toward greatness. He was also the leader who betrayed the French Revolution in exchange for the imperial mantle. A consummate politician and showman, he did much to nullify this about-face by portraying himself as a liberal conqueror, spreading the ideals of the Revolution throughout a Europe ruled by absolutist monarchs.<br>He has also been described as the enemy of mankind, a despot who ruled Europe as a dictator, and ruthlessly crushed those who stood in his path. Napoleon Bonaparte dominated the period from the French Revolution until 1815 so completely that the era has become known as the Napoleonic Age. For much of this time he remained the Master of Europe, controlling the destiny of millions of people, from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean, and from the English Channel to the Russian steppes.<br>Following his death in 1821, Napoleon Bonaparte and his legacy have been viewed in many ways: from the pale mimicry of imperial grandeur in France during the mid-nineteenth century to the abiding fascination in his military and civil achievements. Tyrant or hero, genius or madman, there is no escaping the ramifications of his life. This book examines this crucial period in world history, and looks into the career of the man who still captivates our imagination.<br><br>ANGUS KONSTAM has written over a dozen books on piracy, shipwrecks, and exploration for the Atlas series.

This unique study of government is the culmination of the work of the late S. E. Finer, one of the leading political scientists of the twentieth century. Ranging over 5,000 years, from the Sumerian city state to the modern European nation state, five themes emerge: state-building, military formats, belief systems, social stratification, and timespan. The three volumes examine both representative and exceptional polities, and focus on political elites of different types. Empires, Monarchies, and the Modern State (Books Four and Five) opens with Tokugawa Japan and thence reviews the evidence of Ch&#39;ing, Ottoman, and Mughal Empires, before turning to facets of the re-creation, modernization&#39;, and transplantation of the European state model. It concludes with the synoptic review of Pathways to the Modern State&#39;. Professor Finer&#39;s cogent descriptive analysis offers both an invaluable reference resource and an exhilarating journey across time and space.</p><p>S. E. Finer is at University of Oxford.`No review can fully capture the breadth and accessibility of S. E. Finer's posthumous magnum opus ... its clarity and readability must be emphasized ... Finer constantly reminds us of exceptions that explain the richness and diversity of polities.'<br>John R. Cramsie, History<br><br>`The range and sweep of these volumes are extraordinary, as is the verve and clarity of the writing. Finer's intellectual authority is maintained through the long but never wearisome journey from Sumerian city states to modern times.'<br>Times Educational Supplement<br><br>`This is political science on the grandest scale: three volumes that provide a history of successive forms of government throughout the world from the earliest times to the present day ... Finer presents material on political systems that most political scientists will be completely unfamiliar<br>with, and gives fresh insights into systems that they might have thought they knew ... What makes it a great book, and one that deserves to be read by all students of government, is Finer's remarkable ability to classify and compare across the entire universe of known systems of government. It is<br>not simply the scholarship and erudition that is breathtaking, but also the confident, clear and imaginative use of comparative tools to describe the significance of the systems of government.'<br>Edward Page, Public Policy</p><h2>Unix Concepts and Applications</h2><p>This book is both an exhaustive reference and an outstanding guide for the beginner.

While the unique legal status of American Indians rests on the historical treaty relationship between Indian tribes and the federal government, until now there has been no comprehensive history of these treaties and their role in American life. Francis Paul Prucha, a leading authority on the history of American Indian affairs, argues that the treaties were a political anomaly from the very beginning. The term &#34;treaty&#34; implies a contract between sovereign independent nations, yet Indians were always in a position of inequality and dependence as negotiators, a fact that complicates their current attempts to regain their rights and tribal sovereignty. Prucha&#39;s impeccably researched book, based on a close analysis of every treaty, makes possible a thorough understanding of a legal dilemma whose legacy is so palpably felt today.</p><p>Francis Paul Prucha, S.J. is Professor Emeritus of History at Marquette University.

The rise of mass politics all over the world in the twentieth century led to the development of new techniques of governing population groups. On the one hand, the idea of popular sovereignty has gained wide acceptance. On the other hand, the proliferation of security and welfare technologies has created modern governmental bodies that administer populations, but do not provide citizens with an arena for democratic deliberation. Under these conditions, democracy is no longer government of, by, and for the people. Rather, it has become a world of power whose startling dimensions and unwritten rules of engagement Chatterjee provocatively lays bare.<br><br>This book argues that the rise of ethnic or identity politics&#x2015;particularly in the postcolonial world&#x2015;is a consequence of new techniques of governmental administration. Using contemporary examples from India, the book examines the different forms taken by the politics of the governed. Many of these operate outside of the traditionally defined arena of civil society and the formal legal institutions of the state. This book considers the global conditions within which such local forms of popular politics have appeared and shows us how both community and global society have been transformed. Chatterjee's analysis explores the strategic as well as the ethical dimensions of the new democratic politics of rights, claims, and entitlements of population groups and permits a new understanding of the dynamics of world politics both before and after the events of September 11, 2001.<br><br><i>The Politics of the Governed</i> consists of three essays, originally given as the Leonard Hastings Schoff Lectures at Columbia University in November 2001, and four additional essays that complement and extend the analyses presented there. By combining these essays between the covers of a single volume, Chatterjee has given us a major and urgent work that provides a full perspective on the possibilities and limits of democracy in the postcolonial world.</p><p>Partha Chatterjee argues that the rise of ethnic or identity politics-particularly in the postcolonial world-is a consequence of new techniques of governmental administration.

In this comprehensive, yet concise and entertaining book, author Gina Spadafori, pet care columnist for Universal Press Syndicate and host of AOL's "Gina Spadafori's Pet Connection," makes a strong case for researching breeds and considering how certain types of dogs will or won't fit an owner's lifestyle. She doesn't pull any punches in describing the fate of dogs who have been wrongly chosen by well-intentioned owners, then given up for possible adoption, but probable euthanasia, because they are too active, too aggressive, poorly trained, or, appallingly, because they don't fit in with the owner's d�cor.<p> For readers considering a purebred dog, Spadafori provides extensive information on selecting a breed that will fit an owner's lifestyle, including sources of possible breeders such as magazines, Internet sites, and AKC breed clubs, and tips for screening breeders to weed out the unscrupulous or the ignorant. She strongly encourages adoption of shelter animals, though, pointing out that many of the dogs who wind up in shelters are healthy, young, and lovable animals who would make excellent pets for the right people. She recommends proceeding with caution when shopping pet stores for puppies due to the high percentage of pet store puppies that come from puppy mills where animals are bred indiscriminately and often kept in horrifying conditions. Likewise, she discourages purchasing puppies from "backyard breeders" believing that this only encourages irresponsible pet ownership by giving owners a reason to keep breeding their pets rather than altering them.</p><p> Once a breed or type of dog has been selected, <i>Dogs for Dummies</i> moves on to the practical aspects of ownership, including bringing home a puppy or adult dog, feeding and grooming, veterinary care from puppyhood to old age, training and dealing with behavioral problems, and traveling with pets. One of the most interesting chapters of the book debunks common myths about dogs--that a barking dog won't bite, for instance. Spadafori even includes a chapter on silly tricks to teach your dog and another on "must-see" dog sites on the World Wide Web.</p><b>Have you considered buying or adopting a dog but aren't sure where to begin?

Campbell's project is to take stock of what is currently known about the history of Native American languages and in the process examine the state of American Indian historical linguistics, and the success and failure of its various methodologies.<br> <br> There is remarkably little consensus in the field, largely due to the 1987 publication of <em>Language in the Americas</em> by Joseph Greenberg. He claimed to trace a historical relation between all American Indian languages of North and South America, implying that most of the Western Hemisphere was settled by a single wave of immigration from Asia. This has caused intense controversy and Campbell, as a leading scholar in the field, intends this volume to be, in part, a response to Greenberg. Finally, Campbell demonstrates that the historical study of Native American languages has always relied on up-to-date methodology and theoretical assumptions and did not, as is often believed, lag behind the European historical linguistic tradition.</p><p>Lyle Campbell, Head of Department and Professor of Linguistics, University of Canterbury.<br>"It's the kind of book I wish had been available when I was a student and would have saved me many long hours and fruitless searches in libraries....It will be used for a long time to come and well after the furor about Greenberg has died down."--Margaret Langdon, <em>University of California, San</em> <em>Diego</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Two Kingdoms, Two Loyalties: Mennonite Pacifism in Modern America (Center Books in Anabaptist Studies)</h2><p><p>For more than 300 years, Mennonites adhered to a strict two-kingdom theology, owing their supreme adherence to the divine kingdom while serving as loyal, law-abiding subjects to the state in all matters that did not contradict their religious beliefs. Traditionally, Mennonites saw affairs of state as none of their business. In times of war, the Mennonite church counseled conscientious objection and spoke against military participation in either combatant or noncombatant roles. Mennonites did not serve in coercive government offices. Most refused to vote or sue in courts of law, and held a generally negative view of expressions of political protest to government authorities. During World War II, however, the voluntary participation of Mennonites in conscientious objector labor camps pulled Mennonite youth out of rural isolation and raised their awareness of America's social ills and their own responsibilities as Christians. In the post-war era, Mennonites were no longer "the quiet in the land", but began to articulate publicly their concerns about such issues as the draft, the civil rights movement, and the Vietnam War.</p><p>In Two Kingdoms, Two Loyalties, Perry Bush explores the dramatic changes both within Mennonite communities and in their relationship with mainstream American society between the 1920s and the 1970s, as Mennonite society and culture underwent a profound transformation from seclusion to nearly complete acculturation. Congruent with their entrance into national society, Mennonites began to engage the state on a number of issues which an older theological and behavioral tradition had previously defined as outside their sphere of concern. Bush notes that, as was the case in mainstream society, it was primarily the church's youth who were the most passionately involved in the struggle to speak out against war and other concerns.</p><p>Bush's discussion of pacifism and theology parallels the internal struggle for social and cultural change within Mennonite communities nationwide. His study also sheds much light on the role played by religious conservatives in twentieth-century American social movements. Most studies of anti-war and social justice movements have focused on liberal Christian and secular activists, but Bush's account restores Mennonites to a more integral role in the history of recent social dissent. More generally, by reintroducing matters of religious ideology in considerations of recent social history, Two Kingdoms, Two Loyalties highlights the dynamic relationship between social and intellectual developments in twentieth-century America.</p></p><p><p>Perry Bush is associate professor of history at Bluffton College.</p><p>"This book calls into question many of our assumptions about the history of church-state relations in modern America. Hence, this is an extremely valuable book." -- David Harrington Watt, Religious Studies Review</p><br><br><p>"Bush tells this story well.

And there is no one more qualified to write about Gypsy Jazz than Michael Dregni, author of the acclaimed biography, <em>Django</em>.<br><br>A vagabond music, Gypsy Jazz is played today in French Gypsy bars, Romany encampments, on religious pilgrimages--and increasingly on the world's greatest concert stages. Yet its story has never been told, in part because much of its history is undocumented, either in written form or often even in recorded music. Beginning with Django Reinhardt, whose dazzling Gypsy Jazz became the toast of 1930s Paris in the heady days of Josephine Baker, Picasso, and Hemingway, Dregni follows the music as it courses through caravans on the edge of Paris, where today's young French Gypsies learn Gypsy Jazz as a rite of passage, along the Gypsy pilgrimage route to Les Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer where the Romany play around their campfires, and finally to the new era of international Gypsy stars such as Bireli Lagrene, Boulou Ferre, Dorado Schmitt, and Django's own grandchildren, David Reinhardt and Dallas Baumgartner. Interspersed with Dregni's vivid narrative are the words of the musicians themselves, many of whom have never been interviewed for the American press before, as they describe what the music means to them. <em>Gypsy Jazz </em>also includes a chapter devoted entirely to American Gypsy musicians who remain largely unknown outside their hidden community.<br><br>Blending travelogue, detective story, and personal narrative, <em>Gypsy Jazz</em> is music history at its best, capturing the history and culture of this elusive music--and the soul that makes it swing.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael Dregni </strong>is a columnist, reviewer, and feature writer for <em>Vintage Guitar</em> magazine, and author of <em>Django: The Life and Music of a Gypsy Legend</em> (OUP, 2004).<br><br><em>Reviews of the hardback edition:</em><p></p><br>"Dregni's passion for Django Reinhardt and the enduring overlap of gypsy music and jazz leads to a picaresque journey from the US, across modern Europe and back again. The music itself is the wandering hero as Dregni gracefully weaves together historical research, personal insights, and conversations with colorful, music-making characters. Generous, musical storytelling at its best!"-- Ashley Kahn, author of <em>A Love Supreme: The Story of John Coltrane's Signature Album</em><p></p><br>"Dregni writes as Django played: lyrical, inventive, engaging and often undeniably brilliant. With <em>Gypsy Jazz</em> he shines light upon the 'holes in history' that have so long obscured this most celebrated yet mysterious arena of Romany music. An astonishing text."--Garth Cartwright, author of <em>Princes</em> <em>Amongst Men: Journeys With Gypsy Musicians</em><p></p><br>"In this fascinating picaresque adventure into European gipsy culture, Michael Dregni not only discovers much hitherto undocumented information about the background to the great manouche guitarist Django Reinhardt, but also about his musical and social forbears, contemporaries and heirs. Dregni's sparky prose and fervent enthusiasm enliven his search, which always comes back to the music itself, in which he finds, alongside the influence of American jazz, a timeless romani wistfulness, the lingering melancholy of an itinerant people."--Alyn Shipton, Jazz critic of <em>The Times</em>, London, and author of <em>A New History of Jazz</em><p></p><br>"A highly original book that's part history, part detective story and part travelogue... <br>Dregi does a beautiful job tracking down the details and making the people and music come alive. <em>Gypsy Jazz</em> is an important and delightful addition to the ongoing story of Gypsy jazz, and provides an essential bridge to this fascinating people and their culture." --<em>All About Jazz</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Generalist Social Work Practice: A Worktext</h2><p>Charles Zastrow-a leader in the field for over forty years-combines the key components of traditional and contemporary approaches to teaching social work practice into one comprehensive volume in the 11th edition of Generalist Social Work Practice.

Initially descriptive, it evolved into a developmental theory, then into a developmental object relations theory, and, finally, into a developmental self and object relations theory. Now, with the recent emergence of attachment theory and the theory of the neurobiologic development of the self, the picture is complete and a clear and comprehensive statement to depict the origin and development of the personality disorders has taken shape. Dr. Masterson and his fine team of coauthors have assembled a rich and comprehensive volume that features discussions of transference and countertransference, consciousness, mother-infant attachment, the psychotherapy of trauma, and therapeutic neutrality under challenge, among many other important topics. The members of the team are Margot T. Beattie, Barbara L. Short, Donald D. Roberts, Ken Seider, Steven K. Reed, Joseph Farley, Jerry S. Katz, and Judith Pearson.</p><p><b>James F.

The hallmarks of that change were innovation, globalization, and deregulation. Since 1994, those forces have actually gathered more strength, and the financial landscape continues to undergo large and visible changes around the globe. The discipline that we know as finance has attracted the talents and energies of people from Chicago to Singapore and from Paris to Bombay. </p> <p> Our purpose in writing this book is to instruct students about this fascinating revolution. We describe the wide array of financial securities that are now available for investing, funding operations, and controlling various types of financial risk. We help the students to see each kind of security as a response to the needs of borrowers, lenders, and investors, who manage assets and liabilities in a world of constantly changing interest rates, asset prices, regulatory constraints, and international competition and opportunities. Our book devotes a considerable amount of space to explaining how the world's key financial institutions manage their assets and liabilities and how innovative instruments support that management. Also, the text gives students a thorough introduction to financial regulation and to major facets of international finance. </p> <p> It is a safe bet that change will mark the discipline of finance over the foreseeable future and will produce new kinds of institutions, markets, and securities. Our extensive explanation of the developments that dominate today's financial scene provides students with the sense of institutional structure and the analytical tools that they will need to understand the innovations that will surely occur throughout their careers. </p> <p> Our coverage of institutions, investors, and instruments is as current and up-to-date as we can produce in the face of frequent and significant change both in the United States and around the world. We have made a major effort to get the latest information and data on the players in the global financial game and the rules by which it is played. We think our focus on the actual practices of financial institutions is particularly beneficial to students who will, as noted above, inevitably have to respond to changes in those institutions and their environment. </p> <p> We believe that our book differs in several key respects from many texts on financial institutions and markets. What follows is an outline of the key differences. </p> <p> The first difference, and a special feature of this text, is its lengthy coverage of the securitization of assets and the large mortgage market (both residential and commercial). Securitization is the process by which a security, whose collateral is the cash flow from a pool of individually illiquid and often small assets, is created and sold-in the capital markets. Asset securitization has been a major innovation of the past 20 years and represents a radical departure from the traditional system for financing needs by manufacturing companies, finance companies, and governments throughout the world. The mortgage-backed security is the prime example of this process and accounts for the largest part of the market for securitized assets. However, the issuance of securitized pools of credit card debt, auto loans, other consumer liabilities, and receivables from intellectual property is becoming a very important part of international financial markets. The text devotes a considerable amount of time to securitized assets and their markets and offers chapters on mortgage loan securitization as well as the securitization of other assets. </p> <p> The second difference is our commitment to giving the students a substantial amount of information and analysis regarding international or global topics in finance. Our discussions range across a wide field, encompassing markets for bonds and stocks as well as mutual funds in Tokyo, London, Frankfurt, and Paris, among other places. The text gives some detailed explanations about the operations, structure, and regulation of these major markets and institutions. Just a glance at the table of contents shows that this book covers many international topics, which today's students must know in order to function in the increasingly integrated international financial system where they will soon be working. </p> <p> The third difference is the book's extensive coverage of the markets for derivative, securities, such as options, futures, swaps, customized agreements for controlling interest rate risk, and so on. These derivative securities and their markets grow ever more important m global finance. Though the popular press often criticizes and misrepresents these instruments, derivatives enable financial practitioners to control risk and the cost of funding. Because of these instruments, financial markets in the United States and throughout the world are more efficient and can contribute more to economic development and growth. </p> <p> Our discussion of options naturally contains an explanation of the theoretical principles of pricing. We often show that option pricing theory also applies to complex securities that have embedded options. For example, many kinds of bonds contain optionlike provisions: Issuers may exercise some, and holders may exercise others. Students need to understand options and pricing theory if they are to grasp the valuation of many of today's important assets. Although the text does not delve deeply into trading strategies, it does contain a great deal of information on these contracts and is suitable as a supplementary text for a course dealing with derivatives. </p> <p><b>PLANNING AND MANAGING A COURSE</b></p> <p> We do not believe that an instructor has the time in a single semester to treat all the topics covered by this book. The following table contains our suggestions for the chapters that should be included in a one-semester course on financial markets and institutions. The table also identifies those chapters that render the text a useful supplement for a course in investments or one in derivative securities. </p> <p><b>CHANGES FROM THE SECOND EDITION</b></p> <p> We have changed the text in several ways. First, we have updated all discussions of financial institutions in the United States and around the world, and we have revised the tables and charts, using the most current information and numbers we could find. Second, we have substantially revised the following chapters: 7 (Insurance Companies), 8 (Investment Companies and Exchange Traded Funds), 9 (Pension Funds), 18 (Common Stock Markets), 19 (Stock Markets Around the Worlds), and 25 (Asset-Backed Securities Markets). </p> <p> To help us in updating the book, we recruited another coauthor, Dr. Frank J. Jones, chief investment officer of The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America. His experiences in asset management, as well as his many experiences in the development of financial products prior to joining, provide significant insights. </p></p><h2>NLT Life Recovery Bible (Personal Size, Softcover) 2nd Edition: Addiction Bible Tied to 12 Steps of Recovery for Help with Drugs, Alcohol, Personal Struggles - With Meeting Guide</h2><p>Tyndale&#x2019;s <i>The Life Recovery Bible</i> is the #1&#x2013;selling recovery Bible with over 3 million copies in print.

Hugh Trevor-Roper explores three myths across 400 years of Scottish history: the political myth of the ancient constitution&#x201d; of Scotland; the literary myth, including Walter Scott as well as Ossian and ancient poetry; and the sartorial myth of tartan and the kilt, invented ironically, by Englishmen in quite modern times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trevor-Roper reveals myth as an often deliberate cultural construction used to enshrine a people&#x2019;s identity. While his treatment of Scottish myth is highly critical, indeed debunking, he shows how the ritualization and domestication of Scotland&#x2019;s myths as local color diverted the Scottish intelligentsia from the path that led German intellectuals to a dangerous myth of racial supremacy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This compelling manuscript was left unpublished on Trevor-Roper&#x2019;s death in 2003 and is now made available for the first time. Written with characteristic elegance, lucidity, and wit, and containing defiant and challenging opinions, it will absorb and provoke Scottish readers while intriguing many others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> I believe that the whole history of Scotland has been coloured by myth; and that myth, in Scotland, is never driven out by reality, or by reason, but lingers on until another myth has been discovered, or elaborated, to replace it.&#x201d; Hugh Trevor-Roper</p></p><p><p>The late Hugh Trevor-Roper (Lord Dacre of Glanton) was Regius Professor of History at the University of Oxford and a prolific scholar.

This classic biography of Nietzsche was first published in the 1960s and was enthusiastically reviewed at the time. Long out of print, it is now reissued with its text updated in the light of recent research. The biography chronicles Nietzsche&#39;s intellectual evolution and discusses his friendship and breach with Wagner, his attitude toward Schopenhauer, and his indebtedness to Darwin and the Greeks. It follows the years of his maturity and his mental collapse in 1889. The final part of the book considers the development of the Nietzsche legend during his years of madness. R. J. Hollingdale, one of the preeminent translators of Nietzsche, allows Nietzsche to speak for himself in a translation that transmits the vividness and virtuosity of Nietzsche&#39;s many styles. This is the ideal book for anyone interested in Nietzsche&#39;s life and work who wishes to learn why he is such a significant figure for the development of modern thought. R. J.

This new edition, revised in style and corrected and updated in context throughout, and furnished with a new preface and an important appendix supplying an overview of recent developments in scholarship on Nietzsche, should equip new generations of students with the orientation, understanding, and critical sympathy they will need to face the challenges posed to the contemporary world by Nietzsche, and by those who claim to represent him." Glenn W. Most, The University of Chicago<br><br>"Mr. Hollingdale has written a scholarly and attractive study of both the man and his work. It enables us to see Nietzsche against his own background; and to see how he was converted into a prophet being of the Nazi movement."

Mr. Hollingdale writes extremely well, and he never fails to make his subjects at the very least, endlessly interesting." Philip Toynbee, Observer<br><br>"An admirable work. Mr. Hollingdale gives an impartial account of Nietzsche's life and writings and shows the reader how to make his way through the maze of controversial literature. His thorough analysis of Nietzsche's writing, his illuminating translations of key passages, and his generous acknowledgements of previous commentators make his book a reliable and stimulating guide to the strange, formidable, unhappy figure depicted in it."

Breaking down the barriers between physics, chemistry, and biology and the so-called soft sciences of psychology, sociology, economics and anthropology, this text explores the universal physical and mathematical principles that govern the emergence of complex systems from simple components.<i>Dynamics of Complex Systems</i> is the first text describing the modern unified study of complex systems. It is designed for upper-undergraduate/beginning graduate level students, and covers a broad range of applications in a broad array of disciplines. A central goal of this text is to develop models and modeling techniques that are useful when applied to all complex systems. This is done by adopting both analytic tools, including statistical mechanics and stochastic dynamics, and computer simulation techniques, such as cellular automata and Monte Carlo. In four sets of paired, self-contained chapters, Yaneer Bar-Yam discusses complex systems in the context of neural networks, protein folding, living organisms, and finally, human civilization itself. He explores fundamental questions about the structure, dynamics, evolution, development and quantitative complexity that apply to all complex systems. In the first chapter, mathematical foundations such as iterative maps and chaos, probability theory and random walks, thermodynamics, information and computation theory, fractals and scaling, are reviewed to enable the text to be read by students and researchers with a variety of backgrounds.</p><p><b>Yaneer Bar-Yam</b> is President and founder of the New England Complex Systems Institute and Associate in the department of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University.

In fact, as Dana Ballard argues in this book, computational tools are essential for understanding brain function. Ballard shows that the hierarchical organization of the brain has many parallels with the hierarchical organization of computing; as in silicon computing, the complexities of brain computation can be dramatically simplified when its computation is factored into different levels of abstraction.</p><p>Drawing on several decades of progress in computational neuroscience, together with recent results in Bayesian and reinforcement learning methodologies, Ballard factors the brain's principal computational issues in terms of their natural place in an overall hierarchy. Each of these factors leads to a fresh perspective. A neural level focuses on the basic forebrain functions and shows how processing demands dictate the extensive use of timing-based circuitry and an overall organization of tabular memories. An embodiment level organization works in reverse, making extensive use of multiplexing and on-demand processing to achieve fast parallel computation. An awareness level focuses on the brain's representations of emotion, attention and consciousness, showing that they can operate with great economy in the context of the neural and embodiment substrates.</p></p><p><p>Dana H. Ballard is Professor in the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin, where he has appointments in Psychology, the Institute for Neuroscience, and the Center for Perceptual Systems. He is the author of <i>An Introduction to Natural Computation</i> (MIT Press).</p>This is a very readable and much needed book. I can easily see it being a standard part of a reading list for a graduate student starting off in neuroscience (computational or biological) or a core element of a graduate course. It would also be an excellent read for anyone seeking a snapshot of brain science. ... I feel Ballard's book will remain a strong contribution for a long time to come.This book is a 'must read' for anyone interested in understanding the human brain.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Current Biology</i> review by John Tsotsos, York University)<br></p><h2>The Human Odyssey: Life-Span Development (with InfoTrac)</h2><p>With a unique balance and depth of coverage across all age groups, this book examines the physical and intellectual changes humans undergo from conception through death.

In the critically acclaimed <i>Naked</i> <i>Airport</i>, Alastair Gordon traces the cultural history of this defining institution from its origins in the muddy fields of flying machines to its frontline position in the struggle against international terrorism.<br> From global politics to action movies to the daily commute, Gordon shows how the airport has changed our sense of time, distance, and style, and ultimately the way cities are built and business is done. He introduces the people who shaped and were shaped by this place of sudden transition: pilots like Charles Lindbergh, architects like Le Corbusier, and political figures like Fiorello LaGuardia and Adolf Hitler. <i>Naked</i> <i>Airport</i> is a profoundly original history of a long-neglected yet central component of modern life.<br> <br> &#x201c;This charming history documents why airports have always been such intriguing places. Gordon wittily deconstructs air terminal architecture. . . .

He is the author of several books including <i>Weekend Utopia</i>,<i> Spaced Out</i>,<i> Beach Houses</i>,<i></i>and<i> Romantic Modernist.&nbsp;</i><i></i>&nbsp;<i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Airports have been with us for less than a century, yet in that relatively brief period they have undergone a startling and wholesale metamorphosis. What was once the starting point for journeys that promised romance, excitement and the unknown is now, as Alastair Gordon aptly describes it, a place of "jaded realism, apathy, and paranoia." Paris tells the tale. The Le Bourget, where Charles Lindbergh ended his epic flight in 1927 -- "The grounds were neatly landscaped, with gravel walkways and lines of pollarded trees; it all looked more like a corner of the Tuilleries Gardens than an airport" -- has given way to Charles de Gaulle, a chilly, chaotic, almost unimaginably hideous mausoleum that a friend of mine calls, perhaps flatteringly, a "Third World airport." <p>To describe the airport, as Gordon does in his subtitle, as "the world's most revolutionary structure" is perhaps a tad hyperbolic -- what about the post-and-beam house or the skyscraper? -- but there can be no doubt that it is an essential part of the modern world or that its influence extends far beyond its own territory. As Gordon says: "The airport is at once a place, a system, a cultural artifact that brings us face-to-face with the advantages as well as the frustrations of modernity. The sprawling, hybrid nature of the subject challenges easy assumptions. Its history has been a recurrent cycle of anticipation and disappointment, success and failure, innovation and obsolescence." </p><p>Gordon takes his title from the architect Le Corbusier, high priest of the Bauhaus school, who declared in the 1930s that "the beauty of an airport is in the splendor of wide open spaces!" He believed, in Gordon's words, that "nothing could compete with the [airplane] itself, and thus the only appropriate architecture was one that was practically invisible: just 'sky, grass, and concrete runways.' " In brief, � la Le Corbusier: "An airport should be naked." </p><p>Some visionary he was. The typical airport of the early 21st century is about as naked as a fully provisioned American combat soldier. Dating back to the 1950s, as jets began to replace propeller airplanes and then as jets got bigger and bigger, and as the democratization of flight brought ever-larger crowds into airports, people who designed terminals stopped trying to make them monumental, in the pattern of railroad stations, and treated them as purely functional. They were built 10 or more miles outside the cities they served, and they turned into cities themselves: </p><p>"Airports of the 1960s offered urban planners a new template for the modern city -- one that would resolve the problem of the old city center by ignoring it altogether. Gigantic new complexes were built expressly to accommodate jet travel. They were no longer like cities, but were real, self-contained urban nodes, servicing millions of passengers a year and hiring thousands of employees. By the mid-1960s, Idlewild/Kennedy was providing employment for over nineteen thousand people earning collectively over $150 million a year. Jet-age airports would have their own police and fire departments, power plants, fuel dumps, dentists, doctors, hotels, conference centers, and, in some cases, theaters, nightclubs, and churches." </p><p>The contrast to the airport of the 1920s and 1930s is startling. Not merely were the original airports small, close to the cities they served and lightly populated, but they had real character. Gordon quotes a passage from Graham Greene's novel England Made Me (1935) about the airports of Europe: "Shabby Le Bourget; the great scarlet rectangle of the Tempelhof as one came in from London in the dark, the head lamp lighting up the asphalt way; the white sand blowing up around the shed at Tallin; Riga, where the Berlin to Leningrad plane came down and bright pink mineral waters were sold in a tin-roofed shed; the huge aerodrome at Moscow with machines parked half a dozen deep, the pilots taxiing casually here and there, trying to find room, bouncing back and forth, beckoned by one official with his cap askew. It was a comfortable, dull way of traveling."</p><p>Now it's merely dull; nothing about it -- nothing at all, from the long lines at security to the minuscule legroom aboard the plane itself -- can be described as comfortable. Gordon dates the change to Nazi Germany and World War II. The former built Tempelhof, which "signaled the beginning of a new phase in airport history. 'The dethroning of the individual is the most essential principle of our now victoriously conquering movement,' said propaganda minister Goebbels, and the Reich's airport was an architectonic reflection of this mob philosophy. The message was assimilation and control." As, of course, it is to this day, thanks as well to the war, when "travel took on a new sense of urgency in a world where international tensions mounted, treaties were broken, and disputed territories were annexed by force." </p><p>Then in the 1970s, "as aerial hijackings became more common," security was ratcheted up (though not enough to forestall the calamity of Sept. 11), and the "architectural style of the day became, as one critic described it, a 'beefy concrete idiom,' fashioned by security codes and characterized by slabs of cast concrete, massive roofs, and roughly finished surfaces. . . . Antiterrorist measures turned the airport into an electronically controlled environment rivaled only by the maximum security prison." In "the arcane parlance of the day, the airport was referred to as the Passenger Processing System." Perhaps by now the parlance has changed, but the processing system has only gotten worse -- more mechanical, more intrusive, more contemptuous of all those who must pass through it. </p><p>This is dictated far more by cold reality than by airport architects and operators, though doubtless these could make airports more inviting and less brutal without jeopardizing security. The new Reagan National Airport (which for some reason Gordon does not mention, though he does mention its predecessor, Washington National) manages to do this rather well, but then it is used by comparatively small planes, has few cross-country nonstop flights and no transoceanic flights at all. For a more faithful representation of the contemporary airport, the curious Washington-area resident must venture to Dulles, where Eero Saarinen's wonderful original design is barely visible among all the Jersey barriers and parking lots, or to Baltimore-Washington International (BWI), which years ago made a mockery of its original name, Friendship. </p><p>Though blame for all this is reflexively fixed on the terrorists, the larger truth is that it's a condition of the modern world. People by the millions have to travel on business or want to travel for pleasure, and they have to be -- what other word will do? -- processed. Unless you have the wherewithal to travel first or business class, unless you belong to one of those "clubs" with which airlines reward their most frequent fliers, you have little choice except to place yourself in the hands of a processing system that is rude, dehumanizing, inefficient and exhausting. One April morning this year, my wife and I were on our feet for two and a half hours at the odious Charles de Gaulle, struggling through one security stop after another, not having the chance to sit down until we were shoehorned into the plane itself. </p><p>The price of going to Paris (or any other place you'd like to be) is measured now not in dollars but in fatigue and humiliation. The modern airport is a dreadful place in virtually every respect, and the one certainty is that it will only get worse. Gordon, who obviously likes airports despite themselves, ends his interesting, informative book on an upbeat note, but it's unlikely that he'd find agreement among any but the most privileged of travelers. The modern airport is the Tenth Circle of Hell. </p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Malin translates quantum mechanics into plain English, explaining its origins and workings against the backdrop of the famous debate between Niels Bohr and the skeptical Albert Einstein. Then he moves on to build a philosophical framework that can account for the quantum nature of reality. He draws out the linkage between the concepts of Neoplatonism and the more recent process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead.<br> Writing with broad humanistic insight and deep knowledge of science, and using delightful conversation with fictional astronauts Peter and Julie to explain more difficult concepts, Shimon Malin offers a profound new understanding of the nature of reality--one that shows a deep continuity with aspects of our Western philosophical tradition going back 2,500 years, and that feels more deeply satisfying, and truer, than the clockwork universe of Newton.<br></p><p>God, Albert Einstein famously observed, does not play dice with the universe. Much of quantum physics, a field of study that Einstein helped initiate and that has extended his theories into the oddest of corners, is so materialistic that it can find little room for speculation about the role of chance in the universe--and, indeed, for a supreme being at all.<p> Shimon Malin, a professor of physics at Colgate University, notes that we are in the midst of a paradigm shift in our thinking about the universe and our place in it. With its "principle of objectivation" and its positing of a mysterious "collapse of quantum states" and multiple realities, among other theses, the new physics suggests that "nature is an organism whose functioning cannot be reduced to a set of mechanisms." The resultant uncertainty has undermined traditional views of religion and human purpose, and philosophy has only begun to account for it. But, Malin suggests, that uncertainty need not lead to meaninglessness or nihilism. If we consider the universe to be alive and intelligent, and if we nurture "conscious attention" to it, then we become witnesses to and participants in its order and completion, even if we do not completely understand it.</p><p> Confused? It's easy to be confounded, for lines of thought in modern science and philosophy alike can be difficult to follow. Malin writes lucidly about the new physics, the quest for an overarching "theory of everything," and the search for meaning in an apparently inanimate creation. If his discussions sometimes get a little tangled, well, that's the nature of the subject itself. Whatever the case, there is much to ponder in his well-written book, and much to learn. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br><strong>Shimon Malin</strong> is a Professor of Physics at Colgate University.

The plot focuses on Eliot Rosewater, the primary trustee of the philanthropic Rosewater Foundation, whom one of the family lawyers, Norman Mushari, is attempting to have declared insane, in order for a distant relative, Fred Rosewater, an insurance salesman from Rhode Island, to gain control.</p><p>A rich man attempts a noble experiment with human nature. The result is an etched-in-acid portrayal of universal greed, hypocrisy, and follies of the flesh.Kurt Vonnegut is a unique voice in the American canon &#x2014; a writer whose works are hard to categorize, often straddling the space between literature and science fiction, and filled with cutting satire and dark humor. Like Mark Twain before him, Vonnegut's reputation and impact on American writing and reading will continue to grow steadily and increase in relevance as new insights are made. Vonnegut was born in 1922 in Indianapolis, and studied at the University of Chicago and the University of Tennessee. In the Second World War, he became a German prisoner of war and was present during the bombing of Dresden. This experience provided inspiration for his most successful and influential novel, Slaughterhouse-Five. Vonnegut &#x2014; admired as much for his views and his &#x201c;Vonnegutisms&#x201d; as for his publications &#x2014; wrote extensively in many forms, including novels, short stories, essays, plays, articles, speeches, and correspondence, some of which was published posthumously.</p><h2>Gigi, Julie de Carneilha, and Chance Acquaintances: Three Short Novels</h2><p><p>Two volumes of Colette's most beloved works, with a new Introduction by Judith Thurman.</p><p>Perhaps Colette's best-known work, <i>Gigi </i>is the story of a young girl being raised in a household more concerned with success and money than with the desires of the heart. But Gigi is uninterested in the dishonest society life she observes all around her and remains exasperatingly Gigi. The tale of Gigi's success in spite of her anxious family is Colette at her liveliest and most entertaining. Written during the same period as <i>Gigi</i>, <i>Julie de Carneilhan</i>, based on Colette's last years with her second husband, focuses on a contest of wills between Julie, an elegant woman of forty, and her ex-husband. <i>Chance Acquaintances</i>, a novella, involves an invalid wife, her philandering husband, and a music-hall dancer whose odd meeting at a French spa affects and indelibly marks each one of their lives.</p></p><p>Born in 1873 in France, <b>Colette </b>was the author of many acclaimed novels noted for their intimate style.

Recent research has emphasized the need to look again at original texts, documents, and artifacts. Any new evaluation of the historical significance of the Renaissance requires attention to these kinds of primary evidence. This anthology responds to the impetus with an important collection of primary sources, selected to reflect the richness and wide variety of Renaissance studies.<br><br>The original texts are arranged thematically, and each is introduced by a brief headnote describing the author and the source. Sections of the volume are devoted to humanism and its impact on music, philosophy, and politics; Renaissance court culture; poetry and drama in Renaissance Britain; the Reformation; and science, magic, and witchcraft. Some of the texts are short and familiar, others&#x2015;such as an early sixteenth-century demonology by Italian humanist Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola&#x2015;appear here in translation for the first time. The anthology is illustrated throughout.</p><p>Peter Elmer is staff tutor and lecturer in the History of Science and Technology at The Open University.

Roberta Wood is course manager in the Arts Faculty at The Open University.Yale University, in association with the Open University in London, has released three volumes of its five-volume "The Renaissance: A Cultural Enquiry" series, which will comprise two anthologies and three course texts. The goal of the series is to explore the Renaissance from the perspectives of political thought, history, philosophy, religion, music, art, drama, and literature. The first volume, The Impact of Humanism, examines the continuing relevance of Jacob Burckhardt's seminal 1860 work, The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (Phaidon Pr., 1995). The Renaissance in Europe: An Anthology presents a selection of primary sources illuminating a wide range of subjects, from a Sforza banquet menu to Luther's The Babylonian Captivity of the Church. The third volume, The Renaissance in Europe: A Reader, considers the importance of the Renaissance to the development of Western Civilization by presenting over 30 readings by leading scholars on the themes of humanism, authority, and the roles of men and women. The last two volumes, Courts, Patrons and Poets and Challenges to Authority, will be published in fall 2000. This thoroughgoing series will be of use primarily to students and scholars of the Renaissance.

Who does not know it, at least by name? Who has not seen it roam amid the grass, like a spark fallen from the moon at its full? The Greeks of old called it [Greek: lampouris], meaning, the bright-tailed. Science employs the same term: it calls the lantern-bearer, Lampyris noctiluca, LIN. In this case, the common name is inferior to the scientific phrase, which, when translated, becomes both expressive and accurate.</p><p></p><h2>Debating Sex and Gender (Fundamentals of Philosophy Series)</h2><p>The fifth volume in the Fundamentals of Philosophy Series, <em>Debating Sex and Gender</em> by Georgia Warnke is a concise yet in-depth introduction to contemporary feminist thought on sex and gender. Featuring a lucid and accessible writing style, the book focuses on four historical debates: the relation and possible distinction between sex (biologically based) and gender (culturally based); questioning the binary (male-female) character of sex and gender; the idea of gender as a performance and as a performative; and the intersection of gender with race, class, and other features of identity. These discussions serve as guides for the first four chapters of the book. The fifth chapter strives to resolve the four issues by situating sex and gender within a broader theory of identity, arguing that sex and gender are ways of understanding who people are and do not define us any more than other characteristics do. Unique in its exploration of several different debates--and their relationship to each other--<em>Debating Sex and Gender</em> is ideal for use in a variety of feminist philosophy, women's studies, and gender studies courses.<br></p><p><br><strong>Georgia Warnke</strong> is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Associate Dean of Arts and Humanities at the University of California, Riverside.<br><br>"<em>Debating Sex and Gender</em> offers a clear, concise, and useful overview of methodological, interpretive, and historical distinctions between sex and gender.

Clearly directed toward undergraduates, it is the sort of text that will easily find its way into Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies courses."--Thomas F. DeFrantz, <em>MIT</em><p></p><br>"The volume provides a clear, interesting, and comprehensive overview of the range of views concerning sex and gender. I predict that it will be used not only in women's studies classes, but also in feminist classes in various disciplines, including philosophy, psychology, and sociology."--Nancy Tuana, <em>Penn State University</em><p></p><br>"A concise yet rich guide to the sex/gender debates. . . .

They need to understand the cross-cultural, global exchanges that shaped Western history; to be able to draw connections between the social, cultural, political, economic, and intellectual happenings in a given era; and to see the West not as a fixed region, but a living, evolving construct. These needs have long been central to <i>The Making of the West</i>. The book&#x2019;s chronological narrative emphasizes the wide variety of peoples and cultures that created Western civilization and places them together in a common context, enabling students to witness the unfolding of Western history, understand change over time, and recognize fundamental relationships.</p><p><b>LYNN HUNT</b> (Ph.D., Stanford University) is Eugen Weber Professor of Modern European History at University of California, Los Angeles.

You will find help with unfamiliar words, with imagery, and with other &#39;poetic&#39; features, as well as suggestions for practical work.</p><p>Shakespeare's sonnets, the greatest of Elizabethan sonnet sequences, were first published in an unauthorized version in 1609. William Shakespeare was then forty-five years old, a successful playwright, a country gentleman, and an affluent member of the Globe, the most important theatrical enterprise in London.<br>Although the sonnets are among the finest poems in the English language, questions about them have preoccupied scholars for several hundred years. This edition portrays the sonnets in the order and sequence thought to be traditional.<br>This edition of the sonnets also includes imaginative, flowing illustrations of Charles Robinson. One of the most popular of Edwardian artists, he was acclaimed for his highly original coloring and flights of fantasy. His illustrations add an unusual dimension to the sonnets, which are unequalled in their poetic power, exploration of intimate human relationships, and sensitivity to tragedy of human aspirations.Each sonnet is presented with guidance to assist the reader to make his or her own personal response. Help is given with imagery and other features of language, and the editor has included a wide range of classroom-tested activities for individual and group work. This edition aims to give students access to the multiple meanings and responses which each sonnet can evoke, and so discover Shakespeare&#39;s delight in language and exploration of personal feeling.</p><h2>One Thousand and One Nights: A Retelling</h2><p>Passed down over centuries from India, Persia, and across the Arab world, the mesmerizing stories of&nbsp;<i>One Thousand and One Nights</i>&nbsp;are related&nbsp;by the beautiful, young Shahrazad as she attempts to delay her execution. Retold in modern English by the acclaimed Lebanese author Hanan al-Shaykh, here are stories of the real and the supernatural, love and marriage, power and punishment, wealth and poverty, and the endless trials and uncertainties of fate. Bringing together nineteen classic tales, in these pages al-Shaykh weaves an utterly intoxicating collection, rich with humor, violence, and romance.</p><p><p>Hanan al-Shaykh, an award-winning journalist, novelist, and playwright, is the author of the short story collection&nbsp;<i>I Sweep the Sun off Rooftops</i>; the novels&nbsp;<i>The Story of Zahra, Women of Sand and Myrrh, Beirut Blues</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Only in London</i>; and a memoir about her mother,&nbsp;<i>The Locust and the Bird.</i>&nbsp;She was raised in Beirut, educated in Cairo, and lives in London.<br></p>Preface<br> &nbsp;<br> I don&#x2019;t recall exactly whether I was eight or ten years old when I first heard the words <i>Alf layla wa layla</i>, one thousand and one nights, but I do remember listening to a radio dramatization and being utterly smitten: the clamour, hustle and bustle of the bazaars and souks, the horses&#x2019; hooves, the creaking of a dungeon door, how the radio seemed to vibrate and shake at the footsteps of a demon, and the famous crow of the lonely rooster at the start of each episode, which would be answered by all the roosters in our neighbourhood.<br> I heard that a girl in my class had <i>Alf layla wa layla</i>, and I hurried with her to peer at a few volumes in a glass cabinet, next to a carved tusk of an elephant. The volumes were leather-bound, their title engraved in gold. I asked my friend if I might touch one, but she said that her father always locked the cabinet and kept the key in his pocket, because he said he feared that if anyone finished the stories they would drop dead. Of course I didn&#x2019;t know then, and neither did my friend, that the reason her father didn&#x2019;t want any of the women of the house to read <i>Alf layla wa layla </i>was because of its explicit sexuality.<br> As the years passed, my obsession with <i>Alf layla wa layla </i>faded. I wanted desperately to escape the world it evoked. But Shahrazad found her way to me. I decided I must discover why, while most Arabs considered the framing story of Shahrazad to be a mere clich�, academics regarded it as a work of genius and a cornerstone of Arabic literature.<br> I read page after page, marvelling at Shahrazad&#x2019;s perseverance in remaining the king&#x2019;s prisoner in order to reveal to him the truth of her mind. I came to see that her weapon was art at its best, her endless invention of all of those magnificent stories. The more I read, the more I came to admire the flat, simple style I had so criticised in the past. The simplicity of the language touched me, for it was the language of those who didn&#x2019;t reach for a dictionary but expressed their true, crude, raw and intense feelings, whether they praised, elegised or defamed. In these voices lay the foundation of magic realism, the flashback, and the use of the surreal to explain the ordinary&#x2014;all the things I had mistakenly thought <i>Alf layla wa layla </i>lacked.<br> Reading <i>Alf layla wa layla </i>this time was personal: I felt as if I had opened the door of a carriage which took me back into the heart of my Arab heritage, and to the classical Arab language, after a great absence. I was astonished at how our forebears had shaped our societies, showing us how to live our daily lives, through these tales which were filled with insights and moral and social rules and laws, without the influence of religion, but derived from first-hand experience and deepest natural feelings towards every living thing. The effect of <i>Alf layla wa layla </i>was so strong and real that Arab societies shaped themselves around it; the names of its characters were embedded in our language, becoming proverbs, adjectives and even modes of speech. I was in awe of the complex society the stories evoked, which allowed relationships between humans and jinnis and beasts, real and imaginary, and I smiled at the codes of conduct and the carefully laid-out etiquette. But as a female Arab writer my real enchantment was the discovery that women in those forgotten ancient societies were far from passive and fearful; they showed their strong will and intelligence and wit, all the time recognising that their behaviour was the second nature of the weak and the oppressed.<br> When I finished adapting these nineteen stories for the stage and for this book, I thanked Shahrazad for leading me into a myriad of worlds. And, when I stepped back into our century, it dawned on me that in a sense my friend&#x2019;s father was right when he had said that anyone who finished <i>Alf layla wa layla </i>would die: the reader might find herself detached and lifeless when forced to withdraw from the sublime vividness of the numerous worlds of the One Thousand and One Nights. I hope you revel in the journey as much as I did.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Fisherman and the Jinni<br> &nbsp;<br> I heard, oh wise and happy King, that a very poor fisherman who swore by Almighty God that he would only cast his net three times each day, went down to the sea late one afternoon as usual, waited until he saw the moon shining above him, and then threw his net very carefully into the water. He sat there for a time, and then, when he pulled on his net and felt that it had grown heavy, sang to himself:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Glide over to me, my magnificent fish<br> And slither into my waiting net<br> So that someone asleep on his soft silken bed<br> Will awaken and buy you with his silver bread.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He opened his net and there, to his horror, found a dead donkey. &#x201c;A donkey?&#x201d; he cried out. &#x201c;My wretched luck. You send me a donkey when you know that my family and I are starved out of our brains?&#x201d; He managed to free it from his net with one hand while pinching his nose with the other to block out the horrible smell. <br> He cast his net carefully into the sea again, waited for it to sink, tugged on it and to his amazement felt that the net was even heavier than the first time. It was so heavy he had to climb back on to the shore, drive a stake into the ground, and tie the rope of the net to the stake. Then he hauled with all his might until he managed to pull the net up out of the sea. <br> But instead of an abundance of fish jumping and playing in the net he found a broken, rusty wooden chest filled with sand. He shouted in a loud voice, &#x201c;A chest? Is this how you compensate my work? My labour? Or are you telling me that the key to my good fortune lies inside this coffin?&#x201d;<br> He kicked the chest as hard as he could, but then managed to recover his patience, and washed out his net once again.<br> When dawn was about to break the fisherman prayed, raising his hands and lifting his eyes to heaven in supplication. &#x201c;Oh God, I beg of you, have pity on me, I have no other trade and I have sworn that I shall only cast my net three times. This is my last attempt, because I believe that my fortune has been decided and this will be my fate.&#x201d; <br> He cast his net, put his hand on his heart and waited, murmuring to himself, &#x201c;Let us hope that the third time will be lucky.&#x201d;<br> At last he hauled the net ashore and to his amazement found a large brass jar inside, long-necked and sealed with a lid. <br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll sell it in the copper market and buy some wheat,&#x201d; he said to himself. <br> He tried to lift it but it was too heavy and so he shook it, trying to tell what was inside. He examined the lead seal of the lid, on which words were engraved, and then took his knife and slowly eased it open. He tilted the jar to one side but nothing came out, which puzzled him, since the jar was so heavy. He plunged his hand into the jar, but it was empty. Suddenly a column of smoke began to pour out, covering the ground and the sea and moving higher and higher up into the sky until it reached the clouds. The fisherman peered up into the sky as the smoke turned to a black fog and formed the shape of a huge jinni, his head reaching to the sky and his feet planted on the sand. The fisherman wanted to run away, but remained frozen to the spot, as the jinni&#x2019;s head became like a tomb, his eyes like two lanterns, his nostrils like two trumpets, his ears as large as an elephant&#x2019;s, his mouth a frightening cave with teeth like gravestones and two fangs like a pair of pincers. The fisherman shook with fear, his teeth rattled in his mouth, his knees knocked and his feet remained nailed to the ground. <br> But the jinni cried out, &#x201c;Oh Suleiman, Suleiman, the mighty prophet of God, forgive me and pardon me. I promise that I have learned my lesson. I&#x2019;ll never disobey you again and I am now your trusted servant.&#x201d;<br> Hearing the jinni&#x2019;s plea and seeing how he trembled, the fisherman gathered his courage and asked him, &#x201c;What are you saying? The prophet Suleiman died one thousand, eight hundred years ago. Eons have passed. Who are you? And why were you in that jar?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Be glad, be very glad,&#x201d; the jinni replied.<br> &#x201c;Oh! My happy day has come at last,&#x201d; the fisherman said to himself, overjoyed.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Be glad that I am going to kill you,&#x201d; the jinni added.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Kill me? What have I done other than to haul you up from the bottom of the sea and release you from that jar?&#x201d;<br> Hurry up and make a wish,&#x201d; the jinni told him.<br> Hearing this, the fisherman&#x2019;s face lit up and he said, &#x201c;This is what I love to hear! Just give me a second to think what I should ask of you.&#x201d;<br> But the jinni said, &#x201c;Tell me how you wish to die. I promise you that I will fulfil your desire.&#x201d;<br> Why me?&#x201d; the fisherman shrieked. &#x201c;What have I done to you, you ungrateful creature? Let me tell you that until this day I never believed the proverb &#x2018;Beware those you help&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br> But the jinni said to him, &#x201c;Let me tell you my story. I&#x2019;m sure that then you&#x2019;ll understand why I must put you to death.&#x201d;<br> The fisherman said, &#x201c;Please be assured, jinni, that I shall never try to understand why you are going to kill me!&#x201d;<br> Enraged, the jinni shouted, &#x201c;Then you can be assured, fisherman, that I will not be so generous as to ask you how you would like to die.&#x201d;<br> Hurry up then, and tell me your story,&#x201d; the fisherman said. &#x201c;Be quick, for my soul has dropped to my feet in fright.&#x201d;<br> The jinni began his story. &#x201c;I am one of the rebellious jinnis who disobeyed God. I was dragged before the prophet Suleiman who asked me to submit and surrender to him. When I declined he imprisoned me in that jar and sealed it with the name of the Almighty and Magnificent. Then he gave the jar to one of the obedient jinnis, who carried me and threw me in the sea. Before I had completed two hundred years inside that wretched jar I swore an oath that if someone were to release me I would make him rich. But nothing happened and I remained trapped in the jar. After another two hundred years had passed I vowed to myself in my loudest voice, in the hope that the waves would carry my pleas, that whosoever should release me from my prison would receive all the treasures of the Earth. But still no one came to my rescue and another hundred years passed and another and another and I remained, cooped up in the same position in that jar. I found myself screaming and raving and shouting and declaring to the whole world and to myself that whosoever set me free I would subject to the worst death imaginable and then you arrived, and released me from the jar. And so now I am obliged to fulfil my promise.&#x201d;<br> The fisherman nearly fainted, but he pleaded with the jinni, &#x201c;Forgive me jinni, for setting you free. I was only trying to fish, so that my wife and children will not die of hunger. Jinni, if you forgive me, then God will forgive you; if you strike me, then God will strike you down.&#x201d;<br> But the jinni interrupted the fisherman, saying, &#x201c;I must kill you, it is the best reward that I can grant you for setting me free. Now hurry up and choose the manner of your death.&#x201d;<br> The fisherman thought to himself, &#x201c;I am a human being; God has given me reason and made me superior to this jinni. I must use my cunning to defeat his demonic wiles and barbarism.&#x201d; <br> He turned to the jinni, saying, &#x201c;Jinni, do with me what you will, kill me in any way you wish.&#x201d;<br> But just as the jinni took one giant step towards him, the fisherman said quickly, &#x201c;Jinni, before I die, I should like to ask you something.&#x201d;<br> Go ahead and ask then.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Tell me, in the name of the Almighty, were you really inside that jar? Are you sure you weren&#x2019;t playing a trick on me?&#x201d;<br> Of course I was inside it!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;But how? This jar is not big enough for even one of your giant feet.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;So you don&#x2019;t believe me?&#x201d; said the jinni.<br> &#x201c;No, to be perfectly honest, I don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; the fisherman replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never believe it unless I see it with my own eyes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But a rooster crowed, dawn broke and Shahrazad fell silent, sighing to herself. &#x201c;Oh King!&#x201d; her sister, Dunyazad, said from under the bed. &#x201c;What a beautiful and amazing story!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;If the King spares me and lets me live, then I shall tell you tomorrow night what becomes of the fisherman and the jinni,&#x201d; said Shahrazad.<br> &#x201c;I shall let her live and hear the rest of the story tomorrow night and then I shall kill her,&#x201d; Shahrayar said to himself.<br> Shahrazad held her breath with great anguish and fear, awaiting the King&#x2019;s verdict, as if the sword might fall upon her neck at any moment, while Dunyazad peeked out from beneath the bed, panting and panicking. <br> This moment seemed to stretch out into a century, but finally Shahrayar left his bedroom, without calling for his Vizier, the father of Shahrazad and Dunyazad, to order him to have his daughter put to death. Instead he went and sat on his throne, to order and forbid, and the two sisters clung to each other, embracing and weeping, hardly able to believe that their plan had worked, even for one night. Dunyazad touched her sister&#x2019;s face, amazed that she was still alive. When the Vizier realised that his daughter would not be killed that day he shouted for joy and kissed the ground.<br> When night fell over the palace once more, Shahrayar entered his bedchamber, and climbed into his bed. Shahrazad climbed in next to him and the King caressed her and made love to her, while Dunyazad waited patiently under the bed. When the commotion above her subsided, she cleared her throat and spoke into the darkness.<br> &#x201c;Sister, if you are not asleep, can you tell us what became of the fisherman and the jinni?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;If the King wishes to hear it,&#x201d; was Shahrazad&#x2019;s reply.<br> &#x201c;Go ahead,&#x201d; said the King.<br> And Shahrazad answered, &#x201c;With the greatest pleasure.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I heard, oh happy King, that the fisherman answered, &#x201c;I will never believe that you were inside that jar until I see it with my own two eyes.&#x201d;<br> So the jinni shook himself until he once again became smoke which rose into the air and stretched out over the sea and the ground. Then it gathered itself and entered the jar little by little and when the last drifts of smoke disappeared within, the jinni called out, &#x201c;Do you believe me now, you stubborn fisherman?&#x201d; <br> Quick as a flash the fisherman clamped the lead seal over the mouth of the jar and shouted, &#x201c;Now you wretched jinni, how do you wish to die?&#x201d;<br> Realising that the fisherman had tricked him, the jinni struggled to get out. When he found that he was trapped, he called, &#x201c;But fisherman, I was joking when I told you that I wanted to kill you!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re lying,&#x201d; said the fisherman, and he began to roll the jar towards the water&#x2019;s edge.<br> Stop fisherman, stop! What are you going to do with me?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I am going to throw you deep into the sea, and build a hut right here on this spot, lest another fisherman comes along and hauls you out. I want you to remain imprisoned in the darkness of the jar for ever, until Doomsday.&#x201d;<br> The jinni was silent for a moment, and then he spoke in the softest of voices, &#x201c;I beg you fisherman not to do that.&#x201d;<br> Didn&#x2019;t I myself plead with you again and again, telling you to spare me so that God would spare you or destroy me and be destroyed yourself? But you refused.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &#x201c;Release me,&#x201d; the jinni begged him, &#x201c;and I promise that I shall leave you in peace.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Listen jinni, I love my life and it was enough to have nearly lost it the first time I saved you.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Open the jar and I promise to reward you beyond your wildest dreams.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe your promises. They&#x2019;re all lies, because your situation and mine is like that of King Yunan and the sage Duban,&#x201d; said the fisherman.<br> What is that story?&#x201d;<br> And so the fisherman began.</p><h2>Essentials of Aviation Management: A Guide for Aviation Service Businesses</h2><p><p>It is imperative that aviation businesses play an active role in ensuring a positive business climate for their home fields and for other airports as well.</p><p><strong><em>Essentials of Aviation Management: A Guide for Aviation Service Businesses</em></strong> provides the analytical tools that will assist the manager of the aviation service business who wishes to be competitive in today&#x2019;s aviation environment capitalize on challenges and opportunities.

Among the Gospels, Matthew paints a fuller picture of the life, ministry, and teachings of Jesus. Anna Case-Winters's incisive commentary reveals that Matthew is clearly a theological book. It is about God's saving work in Jesus Christ. Moreover, it is presented in a way that easily lends itself to the task of teaching and preaching. Case-Winters highlights five themes that shape the distinctive portrait of Jesus this Gospel offers. Here we see Jesus facing up to conflict and controversy, ministering at the margins, overturning presuppositions about insiders and outsiders, privileging the powerless, demonstrating the authority of ethical leadership, challenging allegiance to empire, and pointing the way to a wider divine embrace than many dared imagine. Case-Winters captures the core of Matthew's unique Gospel, which speaks powerfully to the life of Christian faith today in the midst of our own issues and struggles.</p></p><p><p><b>Anna Case-Winters</b> is Professor of Theology at McCormick Theological Seminary.

The stories - which are at times a shocking reminder of the origins of the present-day anti-capitalist movement - illustrate the extremely delicate and volatile nature of western involvement in the developing world. The message that emerges is clear: unless the lessons of the past are heeded - and corporate social responsibility taken seriously - the current wave of investment will be far less secure than most corporations believe.</p><p>Daniel Litvin has two first class degrees: one in Philosophy, Politics and Economics<br> from Oxford University, and the other in Anthropology and Development from the<br> London School of Economics. He was policy advisor to Rio Tinto, where he advised the mining giant on issues such as debt relief and world trade as well as their internal<br> policies on human rights and bribery and corruption. He resides in London, UK.In recent years, multinational corporations have been blamed for everything from the theft of domestic jobs to economic imperialism to exploiting child workers in Asia. Litvin, a consultant and former correspondent for the Economist, offers a thoughtful and balanced view of these "inherently clumsy, partially sighted giants," including their interactions with host countries and the ways they face the social and political problems that confront them. Litvin begins with histories of the great, early multinationals: the British East India Company, the British South Africa Company, the South Manchurian Railway Company and the United Fruit Company. These firms-arrogant, imperialistic, and corrupt-were often malevolent forces in their host countries: they arranged assassinations, waged wars and exploited native workers. But not all of a multinational's impact on a host country is negative, Litvin argues. The United Fruit Company assisted in a coup that deposed the popularly elected president of Guatemala, Jacobo Arbenz Guzman, in 1954, but it also cultivated land and built houses, railroads and hospitals. Indeed, even a recent transgressor, Nike, has been shown to have given child workers a means of escaping worse alternatives, such as scavenging, street hawking or harsh physical labor. Also, foreign investment by multinationals is frequently the only means by which Third World countries can hope to improve their standard of living. What Litvin illustrates is the cultural complexity corporations confront abroad. Even firms that intend to limit their activities strictly to business often find themselves drawn inadvertently into local politics. But Litvin (who previously drafted human rights guidelines for a multinational) leaves open the question of whether tougher regulations of these giants should be instituted, smartly leaving readers to come to their own conclusions. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>From Tadpole to Frog (Start to Finish, Second Series)</h2><p><p>How does a tadpole become a frog?

With the help of his friend, eccentric Hephaestus Segundo, Simon uses the device to fly through time.

Reprint. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>Despite the flood of sexuality theory and queer cultural studies in 20th-century academia, bisexuality--and the many questions and problems surrounding it--has been little considered. In <i>Vice Versa</i>, Marjorie Garber, director of the Center for Literary and Cultural Studies at Harvard University, takes on this enormous project with refreshing academic rigor and compelling enthusiasm. Covering cultural influences from antiquity through early psychoanalysis to such recent provocateurs as Geraldo Rivera and Susie Bright, Garber calls into question the basic underpinnings of even the most radical views of human sexuality. She suggests that bisexuality is "not just another sexual orientation but rather a sexuality that undoes sexual orientation as a category," and leads us through the ensuing ruckus with wit and grace.<p> <i>Vice Versa</i> offers personal accounts, clinical studies, and analysis from every possible camp to demonstrate Garber's thesis that bisexuality as an idea and an experience "disappears" or is erased from our discussions of sexuality at every turn through the normalizing (not to mention limiting) influence of the terms of the discussion itself. Her call to recognize bisexuality as not only valid but deeply transgressive--and therefore useful--in our culture is urgent and marked by a great affection for her subjects, from Freud to Madonna. "One of the key purposes of studying bisexuality is not to get people to 'admit' they 'are' bisexual," she says, "but rather to restore to them and the people they have loved the full, complex, and often contradictory stories of their lives." <i>--Jessica Peterson</i></p>Marjorie Garber is Professor of English and Director of the Center for Literary and Cultural Studies at Harvard University.</p><h2>The Dancer Defects: The Struggle for Cultural Supremacy during the Cold War</h2><p>The cultural Cold War between the Soviet Union and the West was without precedent. At the outset of this original and wide-ranging historical survey, David Caute establishes the nature of the extraordinary cultural competition set up post-1945 between Moscow, New York, London and Paris, with the most intimate frontier war staged in the city of Berlin. Using sources in four languages, Caute explores the cultural Cold War as it rapidly penetrated theatre, film, classical music, popular music, ballet, painting and sculpture, as well as propaganda by exhibition. Artists such as Miller, Picasso, Eisenstein, Shostakovich, and Stravinsky became involved in this fierce cultural competition through which each of the major Cold War protagonists sought to establish their supremacy. Caute challenges some recent, one-dimensional, American accounts of 'Cold War culture', which ignore not only the Soviet performance but virtually any cultural activity outside the USA. The West presented its cultural avant-garde as evidence of liberty, even through monochrome canvases and dodecaphonic music appealed only to a minority audience. Soviet artistic standards and teaching levels were exceptionally high, but the fear of freedom and innovation virtually guaranteed the moral defeat which accelerated the collapse of the Soviet Union.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Caute</strong> is the author of such books as <em>The Fellow-Travellers</em> and <em>The Great Fear</em>.<br><br>"Based on extensive research in copious books and manuscript collectionsin various languages, Cuate has painted a large and complex canvas of the shifting nature of the culture conflicts of the post-war era. There are no real heroes or villains, only sordid stories of artists attempting to survive and create in a political world that used them as pawns in a power struggle. Cuate has written a fascinating tale of artistic discord."--<em>Journal of Slavic Military Studies</em><p></p><br>"If we want to help our students understand why powerful states react fearfully to alien cultural expressions, and cannot always distinguish cultural difference from hostile intentions, Caute's 'struggle for cultural supremacy' is a good place to start.

However, many&#x2015;both clients and practitioners alike&#x2015;still know very little about it, or are badly misinformed. To those not familiar with it, EMDR can seem overly theoretical and abstract, and if it&#x2019;s not practiced correctly, can be ineffective, or worse, harmful. But with a skilled therapist to carefully guide and facilitate the process, as the author writes, &#x201c;relief is so great it often feels like magic.&#x201d; The purpose of this concise handbook, written by a veteran EMDR practitioner, is to explain EMDR in a simple, straightforward way so that that readers will know what to expect and how to prepare themselves for treatment. Many books on the subject delve into the theory or technical aspects of EMDR. This book does just the opposite. Maiberger focuses on the basics in an easy-to-read way so consumers and therapists alike can quickly understand what it&#x2019;s all about. The first part of the book lays the framework, describing the phases of EMDR treatment, the nature of trauma and its effect on memory, how to choose an EMDR therapist, safety issues, and answering why EMDR works and how it can work for children. In the second part of the book, case examples are presented from the author&#x2019;s clinical experience that put it all into practice, demonstrating exactly how EMDR therapy can successfully resolve deep emotional problems and traumas.</p><p>Barb Maiberger is an author and EMDR trainer specializing in somatic therapies in Boulder, Colorado.EMDR Essentials is the perfect book for the inquisitive client or the beginning EMDR practitioner. --Robin Shapiro, LICSW, editor of EMDR Solutions: Pathways to Healing (W.

The new European states disposed of unprecedented stores of capital and vast military capacities.In recent decades, scholars have often drawn general models of state formation from the European experience after 1700, then applied them with only partial success to other parts of the world. Although such studies of modern Europe improved on early theories of modernization and development, they failed to accommodate the varied ways in which city-states, empires, federations, centralized states, and other forms of government evolved and the pivotal role that cities played in the multiple paths to state formation.In a sweeping, original work detailing eight centuries of city-state relations, Charles Tilly, Wim P. Blockmans, and their contributors document differences in political trajectories from one part of Europe to another and provide authoritative surveys of urbanization in nine major regions; they also suggest many correctives to previous analyses of state formation. They show that the variable distribution of cities significantly and independently constrained state formation and that states grew differently according to the character of urban networks in a given region. Their systematic study shows that unilinear models of state transformation underestimate the contingency and variability of popular and elite compliance with state-building activities. The book&#39;s findings offer important implications for the nature of economy, sovereignty, warfare, state power, and social change throughout the world.</p><p><b>Chris Tilly</b> is associate professor of regional economic and social development at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. <b>Charles Tilly</b> is Joseph L.

Since most social entities, from small communities to <br>large nation-states would disappear altogether if our cognitive abilities ceased to exist, DeLanda proposes a <br>novel approach to social ontology that asserts the autonomy of social entities from the conceptions we have of them. </p><p>He argues that Gilles Deleuze's theory of assemblages provides a framework in which sociologists and geographers studying social networks and regions can properly locate their work and fully elucidate the connections between them. Indeed, assemblage theory, as DeLanda argues, can be used to model any community, from interpersonal networks and institutional organizations, to central governments, cities and nation states.</p></p><p><b>Manuel DeLanda</b> is a distinguished writer, artist and philosopher.

The book now looks at the works and lives of artists from the eighteenth century to the present, including new work in traditional media as well as in installation art, mixed media, and digital/computer art. Mary Jane Hewitt, an author, curator, and longtime friend of Samella Lewis's, has written an introduction to the new edition. Generously and handsomely illustrated, the book continues to reveal the rich legacy of work by African American artists, whose art is now included in the permanent collections of national and international museums as well as in major private collections.</p><p>"Beginning with the arts produced in the Colonial period, Dr. Lewis documents and interprets the flow of creative productions of an important segment of the American population. Her book shows that the range of art produced by African American artists covers the entire spectrum of craft productions through painting, sculpture, and printmaking. There is a progressive development of style that not only reflects the trends in particular periods, but reveals an evolving pattern of indigenous qualities that are distinct. The art community in general and the African American community in particular are fortunate to have Dr. Samella Lewis, for she has developed unusual authority in the area of African American art.

What did mathematicians rely on for their work before then? And how did mathematical notations evolve into what we know today? In <i>Enlightening Symbols</i>, popular math writer Joseph Mazur explains the fascinating history behind the development of our mathematical notation system. He shows how symbols were used initially, how one symbol replaced another over time, and how written math was conveyed before and after symbols became widely adopted.</p><p>Traversing mathematical history and the foundations of numerals in different cultures, Mazur looks at how historians have disagreed over the origins of the numerical system for the past two centuries. He follows the transfigurations of algebra from a rhetorical style to a symbolic one, demonstrating that most algebra before the sixteenth century was written in prose or in verse employing the written names of numerals. Mazur also investigates the subconscious and psychological effects that mathematical symbols have had on mathematical thought, moods, meaning, communication, and comprehension. He considers how these symbols influence us (through similarity, association, identity, resemblance, and repeated imagery), how they lead to new ideas by subconscious associations, how they make connections between experience and the unknown, and how they contribute to the communication of basic mathematics.</p><p>From words to abbreviations to symbols, this book shows how math evolved to the familiar forms we use today.</p></p><p><p>"This book provides an insightful synthesis of the historical and mental revolutions that created humanity's most useful symbols--mathematical expressions."<b>--Stanislas Dehaene, author of <i>Reading in the Brain</i></b></p><p>"Mathematical symbols are much more than squiggles on paper--they serve as potent sources of insight into a wonderfully complex language. In this book, Joseph Mazur takes us on a fascinating journey into the origins of these symbols. You cannot ask for a better guide."<b>--Mario Livio, astrophysicist and author of <i>Brilliant Blunders</i></b></p><p>"Joseph Mazur teaches us that the history of mathematical notation is the history of human civilization."<b>--Kenneth A. Ribet, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"In this thoughtful, entertaining, and carefully researched book, Mazur lays out the development of the mathematical notations and symbols that we take for granted. He offers a fascinating look at the history of the conventions of writing mathematical ideas, and shows how important our choice of conventions has been for the growth of mathematical knowledge."<b>--Emily R. Grosholz, author of <i>Representation and Productive Ambiguity in Mathematics and the Sciences</i></b></p><p>"Worldwide, mathematicians speak a common symbolic language. Mazur traces how symbols developed and gradually took hold, uniting arithmetic, algebra, and geometry to give us metaphors as powerful as those of poems.

Invariably, the source of controversy has been &#34;design.&#34; Is the appearance of design in organisms (as exhibited in their functional complexity) the result of purely natural forces acting without prevision or teleology? Or, does the appearance of design signify genuine prevision and teleology, and, if so, is that design empirically detectable and thus open to scientific inquiry? Four main positions have emerged in response to these questions: *Darwinism* *self-organization* *theistic evolution* *intelligent design*. The contributors to this volume define their respective positions in an accessible style, inviting readers to draw their own conclusions. Two introductory essays furnish a historical overview of the debate. William A.

Analyzing ten extraordinary places, this provocative analysis of historic preservation&#x2019;s past and future will transform contemporary understanding of the movement, examining assumptions about why history, heritage, and place should matter. It ranges broadly from a discussion of the commemoration of place in the Marquis de Lafayette&#x2019;s triumphal tour of the United States in 1824&#x2013;25 to speculation about the cultural and political import of interpreting history on EPA Superfund toxic waste sites.&nbsp; <p>Thinking critically about preservation requires also thinking critically about its opposite: destruction. The book treats the movement to conserve the Hudson River Palisades from destruction at the hands of trap rock quarrymen as well as the effort to save Dutch-American homesteads that stood in the path of development in Brooklyn. It explores the intersection between race, culture, and preservation in the 1940s effort of African Americans to preserve the Mecca Flats in Chicago, an apartment building that was the subject of popular blues music and that was threatened by Mies van der Rohe&#x2019;s designs for the Illinois Institute of Technology.&nbsp;</p><p>Focusing on the relationship among tradition, preservation, and modern design, <em>Buildings, Landscapes, and Memory</em> explores the making of Eero Saarinen&#x2019;s Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Arch on the historic Mississippi riverfront in St. Louis as well as the tension between tradition and modern design at Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s University of Virginia, declared a World Heritage site in 1987.

While much has been written on the subject of political violence in Guatemala, Menj�var turns to a different form of suffering&#x2015;the violence embedded in institutions and in everyday life so familiar and routine that it is often not recognized as such. Rather than painting Guatemala (or even Latin America) as having a cultural propensity for normalizing and accepting violence, Menj�var aims to develop an approach to examining structures of violence&#x2015;profound inequality, exploitation and poverty, and gender ideologies that position women in vulnerable situations&#x2015; grounded in women&#x2019;s experiences. In this way, her study provides a glimpse into the root causes of the increasing wave of feminicide in Guatemala, as well as in other Latin American countries, and offers observations relevant for understanding violence against women around the world today.</p><p>"A rare and groundbreaking contribution to the study of everyday violence. Richly textured by the experiences of Ladino women in eastern Guatemala, <i>Enduring Violence</i> is not only informed by, but serves to inform, cutting-edge theoretical debate which links multiple aspects of personal abuse and rights violations with broader structural and institutional factors. Menj�var's scholarly and sensitive monograph makes a profoundly persuasive case for an holistic conceptualisation of violence that positions women's human rights at the centre of development in 'post-conflict' and other developing states. A 'must read' for all interested in issues of gender, ethnic and other forms of social, economic and political injustice."&#x2015;Sylvia Chant, London School of Economics and Political Science<br><br>"Violence in Guatemala can be a mind-numbing, though urgent and necessary, topic of study. Horrific data mount&#x2015;from state sponsored genocide in the 1980s, to feminicide, lynchings and shadow state violence today&#x2015;but clarifying analysis does not always follow. This insightful and beautifully crafted monograph is a welcome exception. Rather than recognizable interpersonal or overtly political acts, Menjivar focuses on the mundane insults and indignities that women endure, violence so 'normalized' that it often fades from view; she then turns standard causal reasoning on its head, arguing that these 'misrecognized' processes of daily dehumanization are profoundly diagnostic, an unexamined key to why the horrific data keep mounting. Though somber in content, Menjivar's book offers inspiring confirmation that innovative, engaged scholarship on intractable social problems can make a difference."&#x2015;Charles R. Hale, University of Texas at Austin <br><br>"<i>Enduring Violence</i> is of great scholarly importance as it fills a gap in the literature about Guatemala and allows for a nuanced understanding of the ways that women live with violence in their everyday lives. Menjivar's focus on women's discourses of illness, surveillance and endurance is particularly insightful since these narratives symbolize the multiple levels of violence in women's lives and the often imperceptible practices through which a daily life with violence is mediated."&#x2015;M. Gabriela Torres, Wheaton College<br><br>"Menjivar's deep commitment to shedding light on the many forms of violence that women experience is evident throughout her book. She effectively shows how the violence faced by women goes beyond physical violence and has structural origins as well in various forms. This is a great and informative work that needs to be read to understand the structural causes that bring injury to Guatemalan women."&#x2015;Nestor Rodriguez, University of Texas at Austin<br><br>"In <i>Enduring Violence</i>, Cecilia Menjivar presents a perceptive and powerful account of the multiple and entwined layers of violence that permeate the lives of diverse women in Guatemala. The book offers both a valuable theoretical lens and a textured ethnographic analysis, which brings into sharp focus not only the most egregious forms of gender-based physical violence, but also a range of invisible injurious practices rooted in pervasive structures of inequality. Written with empathy, while retaining a critical edge, this accessible and insightful volume sheds light on complex political, economic, and social processes shaping the violent realities of many women in Latin America."&#x2015;Barbara Sutton, author of <i>Bodies in Crisis: Culture, Violence, and Women's Resistance in Neoliberal Argentina</i><br><br>"So much has been written about the spectacular agony of Central America's recent history. In <i>Enduring Violence</i>, Cecilia Menjivar seeks to understand the structures that gird no only the publicly visible violence but also the unspectacular, slow, often silent suffering that defines so many lives in the region. Her moving ethnography may explore the painful particulars of gendered existence in eastern Guatemala, but it also does so in such a way that reveals how deeply embedded inequalities can contort all human relations."&#x2015;Ellen Moodie, author of <i>El Salvador in the Aftermath of Peace: Crime, Uncertainty, and the Transition to Democracy</i><br><br><b>Cecilia Menj�var</b> is Professor and Dorothy L.

Set in the appropriately named Roulettenburg, a German spa with a casino and an international clientele, it concerns the gambling episodes, tangled love affairs, and complicated lives of Alexey Ivanovitch, a young gambler; Polina Alexandrovna, the woman he loves; a pair of French adventurers, and other characters.<br>Although not as dark as some of Dostoyevsky's other works, <i>The Gambler</i> nevertheless offers a grim and psychologically probing picture of the fatal attractions of gambling. Among its strengths are its well-drawn characters &#x2014; Aunt Antonida, although lightly sketched in, is especially delightful &#x2014; and its faithful depiction of life among the gambling set in fashionable German watering holes. This edition reprints Constance Garnett's authoritative translation.</p><p></p></p><p><i>The Gambler</i> brilliantly captures the strangely powerful compulsion to bet that Dostoyevsky, himself a compulsive gambler, knew so well. The hero rides an emotional roller coaster between exhilaration and despair, and secondary characters such as the Grandmother, who throws much of her fortune away at the gaming tables, are unforgettable. The book's publishing history is equally so: Under the pressure of a deadline from an unscrupulous publisher, and with rights to his entire oeuvre at stake, Dostoyevsky dictated the book in less than a month to the star pupil of Russia's first shorthand school. Then he married her.In this dark and compelling short novel, Fyodor Dostoevsky tells the story of Alexey Ivanovitch, a young tutor working in the household of an imperious Russian general. Alexey tries to break through the wall of the established order in Russia, but instead becomes mired in the endless downward spiral of betting and loss. His intense and inescapable addiction is accentuated by his affair with the General&#39;s cruel yet seductive niece, Polina. In &#34;The Gambler, Dostoevsky reaches the heights of drama with this stunning psychological portrait.</p><h2>A Handbook for Beginning Choral Educators</h2><p><p>"This book comes from a very fine music educator with exceptional experience, who has common sense and a real understanding of what a beginning teacher should know.

It is a plain and simple book, written in a language that is easy for anyone going into the profession to understand.

As she learns that true happiness is found in giving oneself to others, you, too, will be immeasurably encouraged to step heavenward&#x2014;to live with greater Godliness, humility, tranquility, and hope.</p><p>Elizabeth Prentiss was born on October 26, 1818 in Portland, Maine, (United States), the daughter of Pastor Edward Payson and his wife Louisa. Elizabeth was deeply impacted by the death of her father, who had suffered from tuberculosis for over a year, on October 22, 1827. The family moved to New York City in 1831, and in May of that year, Elizabeth made a public profession of faith in Christ. Elizabeth was well educated and possessed a gift for writing. In 1838, she opened a small school for girls in her home and took up a Sabbath-school class as well. Two years later, she left for Richmond, Virginia, to be a department head at a girls' boarding school. In 1845 she married George Lewis Prentiss and they settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts, where George became pastor of South Trinitarian Church. After a happy time of transitioning into the duties of a pastor's wife and a housewife, in 1852 she lost, within a period of three months, her second and third children &#x2013; one as a newborn, one at age four. Though Elizabeth struggled with chronic health problems, she went on to have three more healthy children. After George resigned from his church in New York because of failing health, the family went abroad to Europe for a couple of years, returning in 1860 to New York, where George resumed his pastorate and held a chair at Union Theological Seminary. The family eventually settled in Dorset, Vermont, where Elizabeth died in 1878 at the age of 60. Her own hymn "More Love to Thee" was sung at her funeral.</p><h2>31 Days Toward Overcoming Adversity</h2><p>Nothing Is Impossible with God Jesus never said we would be protected from trials and tribulations.

Still others have denied that Christ is truly present in the Eucharist. Do these criticisms have any validity? A thorough investigation of Scripture and history reveals that the answer is a resounding NO. As never before, the Catholic Church has been called upon to be the defender of Scripture and preserver of truth in modern times. Not by Bread Alone will set the biblical and historical record straight. But more importantly, as you learn the real truth about the Catholic Mass, this book will offer you the means to come to one of the deepest relationships with God you have ever experienced. Robert Sungenis has prepared a wonderful defense and explanation of the Holy Eucharist based on Sacred Scripture and Catholic theology. This is a solid Catholic doctrine regarding the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist. It is a fine new look at traditional Catholic Eucharistic theology geared to the eager and fervent Catholic priest and lay person. - Most Reverend Fabian W. Bruskewitz, Bishop of Lincoln, Nebraska Robert Sungenis' work - all of it&nbsp;- fills the word exhaustive with the fresh, and even exhilarating, significance. As with his Not by Faith Alone, one feels that if readers would read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest, this volume on the Eucharist, the questions would be answered. If this book were a hotel, it would get five stars. - Thomas Howard, Ph. D., Author: Evangelical is Not Enough Careful and complete! Robert Sungenis' examination of the Catholic teaching on the Mass is a careful, step by theological step understanding of a key doctrine.&nbsp;He gives the reader the Scripture passages and exegesis, the Patristic and the Conciliar documentation.

When people want to reflect upon the good life and how to live it, they turn to philosophers and novelists, not psychologists. The emerging field of positive psychology aims to redress this imbalance. In Flourishing, distinguished scholars apply scientific analyses to study the good life, expanding the scope of social and psychological research to include happiness, well-being, courage, citizenship, play, and the satisfactions of healthy work and healthy relationships. Their findings reveal that a sense of meaning and a feeling of richness emerge in life as people immerse themselves in activities, relationships, and the pursuit of intrinsically satisfying goals like overcoming adversity or serving one&#39;s community through volunteering.

This edition has been fully updated and expanded to include coverage of the file system, as well as comprehensive information on Windows NT version 4.0.</p><p>Beginning with broad NT concepts and then focusing sequentially on various key systems, Solomon dissects NT with a surgeon's care and a software engineer's thoroughness. That's not to say that this book is mainly about writing programs. Rather, this is the kind of guide that power users wish for, explaining why and how things happen and glossing over very little. Programmers will value the clear NT API hints. <p> Initially, the author talks about important NT tools (such as Performance Monitor) and concepts (such as the idea of virtual memory and how it's mapped). He illustrates all abstract concepts with excellent conceptual drawings that make it easier to comprehend what NT is doing. A chapter on NT's architecture explains how the system works as a whole. Later chapters focus on individual subsystems, providing extensive coverage of processes, memory, input/output, security, caches, and NT. After reading the chapter on memory management, for instance, you'll have a solid grasp of paging and the internal settings that affect it. The book also contains experiments that guide the reader through concept-illustrating procedures. For example, readers crash their machines to see and analyze the dump log--a valuable skill. <i>--David Wall</i></p>A direct consequence of the relatively short time Windows NT has been in use in the industry is represented by the lack of punctual and accurate information about the internals of the system, as opposed to the abundance of texts treating higher level themes. The first edition of <i>Inside Windows NT</i>, written by Helen Custer of Microsoft and based on version 3.1 of the product, was indeed one of the best titles falling into the first category. From that solid ground David Solomon has jumped in, updated the contents, and also added a lot of new insights on those topics that characterize the latest releases of Windows NT. The result is not only an up-to-date reproposition of the former book -- it is a largely restructured and organically reorganized manual, whose focus is on Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3. Frequent marginal notes and the entire final chapter also anticipate what to expect from the upcoming Windows NT 5.0. <p> </p><p>After spending some pages delineating its target and introducing the basic elements that make up the foundation of NT, the book digs deeper and unveils the logic of most aspects of the system. Processes and threads, the mythical memory manager (whose vivisection turned out particularly well), the cache manager, the HAL (acronym for Hardware Abstraction Layer) and the Executive, kernel mode components, and security are just some of the myriad topics covered throughout the chapters. Things like GDI, USER, networking and COM are deliberately left out, as each of them would deserve an entire book. The level of detail is excellent, but I was just as impressed by the high degree of readability and, in general, by the ability of the author to follow a progressive approach in presenting new material without losing sight of the organic whole. The strength of this book&#x2019;s educational aspect is a big upside considering the innate complexity of the subject, and renders <i>Inside Windows NT</i> an extraordinary candidate as a textbook in support of professional seminars and academic courses...Read more from this review. --<i>Davide Marcato, Dr. Dobb's Journal</i> -- <i>Dr. Dobb's Journal</i></p></p><h2>A House on Fire: The Rise and Fall of Philadelphia Soul</h2><p>"If You Don't Know Me By Now," "The Love I Lost," "The Soul Train Theme," "Then Came You," "Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now"--the distinctive music that became known as Philly Soul dominated the pop music charts in the 1970s. In <em>A House on Fire</em>, John A. Jackson takes us inside the musical empire created by Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, and Thom Bell, the three men who put Philadelphia Soul on the map. <br> Here is the eye-opening story of three of the most influential and successful music producers of the seventies. Jackson shows how Gamble, Huff, and Bell developed a black recording empire second only to Berry Gordy's Motown, pumping out a string of chart-toppers from Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes, the Spinners, the O'Jays, the Stylistics, and many others. The author underscores the endemic racism of the music business at that time, revealing how the three men were blocked from the major record companies and outlets in Philadelphia because they were black, forcing them to create their own label, sign their own artists, and create their own sound. The sound they created--a sophisticated and glossy form of rhythm and blues, characterized by crisp, melodious harmonies backed by lush, string-laden orchestration and a hard-driving rhythm section--was a glorious success, producing at least twenty-eight gold or platinum albums and thirty-one gold or platinum singles. But after their meteoric rise and years of unstoppable success, their production company finally failed, brought down by payola, competition, a tough economy, and changing popular tastes. <br> Funky, groovy, soulful--Philly Soul was the classic seventies sound. <em>A House on Fire</em> tells the inside story of this remarkable musical phenomenon.<br></p><p><br><strong>John A.

In his final book, historian Paul Goodman, who died in 1995, presents a new and important interpretation of abolitionism. Goodman pays particular attention to the role that blacks played in the movement. In the half-century following the American Revolution, a sizable free black population emerged, the result of state-sponsored emancipation in the North and individual manumission in the slave states. At the same time, a white movement took shape, in the form of the American Colonization Society, that proposed to solve the slavery question by sending the emancipated blacks to Africa and making Liberia an American "colony." The resistance of northern free blacks was instrumental in exposing the racist ideology underlying colonization and inspiring early white abolitionists to attack slavery straight on. In a society suffused with racism, says Goodman, abolitionism stood apart by its embrace of racial equality as a Christian imperative.<br><br>Goodman demonstrates that the abolitionist movement had a far broader social basis than was previously thought. Drawing on census and town records, his portraits of abolitionists reveal the many contributions of ordinary citizens, especially laborers and women long overshadowed by famous movement leaders. Paul Goodman's humane spirit informs these pages. His book is a scholarly legacy that will enrich the history of antebellum race and reform movements for years to come.<br><br>"[God] hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth."&#x2014;Acts 17:26</p><p>In his final book, Paul Goodman upsets commonly held beliefs about the racial politics of antebellum America. Far from being a "white" republic at its inception, the United States only began to deny African Americans the right to vote after they'd exercised it in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Even those opposed to slavery initially believed that, because racism was so thoroughly ingrained in American society, the only reasonable solution was "colonization," the repatriation of the freed slaves to Africa. But, as Goodman shows, most black American leaders rejected this proposal and were gradually able, primarily through appeal to Christian brotherhood, to convince white abolitionists that genuine racial equality was the ultimate answer to the slavery problem.<p> Goodman is particularly strong at discussing the secular contributions of working-class Americans and women to the abolitionist movement, which dovetailed with other progressivist agendas. It was in abolitionism, for example, that many protofeminists gained the experience in civic activism that would later benefit their own cause. Women, he writes, "had to contend with a form of discrimination that their male counterparts, however supportive they were, did not. And from the experience of contending with that discrimination ... they tended to find their way to an overarching vision of American society, a vision premised on equal rights for all, regardless of class, color, and gender." Although somewhat dry in tone, <i>Of One Blood</i> is rich in historical insight, and it articulates a vision of democratic equality that still resonates in the modern age. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p><b>Paul Goodman</b> taught at the University of California, Davis, for over thirty years.

"Do you see this woman?" "Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?" </strong> These are just some of the many questions that Jesus asked throughout the Gospels. Jesus invites us to inquire, reflect, and discuss. This nine-session Lifeguide is designed to help us dig into some of the questions that shape our view of Jesus and ourselves. For over three decades LifeGuide Bible Studies have provided solid biblical content and raised thought-provoking questions&#x2015;making for a one-of-a-kind Bible study experience for individuals and groups.

Focusing on three core topics: design (the architecture of algorithms), theory (mathematical modeling and analysis), and the scientific method (experimental confirmation of theoretical results), the book helps students see that computer science is about problem solving, not simply the memorization and recitation of languages. Unlike many other texts, the methods of inquiry are explained in an integrated manner so students can see explicitly how they interact. Recursion and object oriented programming are emphasized as the main control structure and abstraction mechanism, respectively, in algorithm design. Designed for the CS2 course, the book includes text exercises and has laboratory exercises at the supplemental Web site.</p><p>Douglas Baldwin (Honeoye Falls, NY) is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at SUNY Geneseo.

Barbara Hendrischke, a leading expert on the Taiping jing in the West, has spent twenty-five years on this magisterial translation, which includes notes that contextualize the scripture&#x2019;s political and religious significance.<br><br> Virtually unknown to scholars until the 1970s, the <i>Taiping jing</i> raises the hope for salvation in a practical manner by instructing men and women how to appease heaven and satisfy earth and thereby reverse the fate that thousands of years of human wrongdoing has brought about. The scripture stems from the beginnings of the Daoist religious movement, when ideas contained in the ancient <i>Laozi</i>were spread with missionary fervor among the population at large. The <i>Taiping jing</i> demonstrates how early Chinese medieval thought arose from the breakdown of the old imperial order and replaced it with a vision of a new, more diverse and fair society that would integrate outsiders&#x2015;in particular women and people of a non-Chinese background.</p><p>"No Western scholar has given the <i>Taiping jing</i> the thorough, painstaking attention that Hendrischke has given it. For the last quarter-century, she has unquestionably been the West's leading expert on the subject. Hendrischke is not only the prime authority on the history and nature of the text itself, but also the prime authority on virtually all related historical materials and issues. Hendrischke draws on this vast knowledge throughout the book. Her arguments are remarkably compelling, the translations are unfailingly precise and expertly nuanced, and there are wonderful tidbits of enlightening new data with fascinating new implications on every page."&#x2015;Russell Kirkland, author of <i>Taoism: The Enduring Tradition</i><b>Barbara Hendrischke</b> is Senior Research Fellow in the School of Modern Languages at the University of New South Wales.

In this book, he tells how he persevered, against the efforts of the U.S. government and pharmaceutical companies, to make them available.</p><p>Nieper is widely known, so his book has a built-in audience who follow his well-trumpeted work and regard him as an antiestablishment hero. He grew up in Germany, where he became interested in physics and medicine. Arriving in the U.S. after World War II, he became associated with the Sloan-Kettering Institute, especially its Cancer Center. There he continued to develop mineral transporters and orthomolecular and eumetabolic nutrient supplements. Those knowledgeable about the fringes of cancer therapy will recognize such names as Krebs, Burk, McNaughton, and Pauling in the text, and also such remedies as laetrile, mandelonitriles, squalene, and iridodials. During the 1992 presidential campaign, Ross Perot's office called on Nieper for advice. Nieper's view of the establishment's reaction to him is indicated by such headings as "The Heavy Hand of the FDA" and "The Harmful Politics of Research and Healthcare." Meanwhile, the book's references are seldom to articles in high-quality journals, and the few that are, are on subjects not really pertinent to Nieper's controversial work. <i>William Beatty</i></p><h2>Diseases and Pests of Ornamental Plants</h2><p>Discusses diagnosis and treatment of diseases and organisms afflicting nearly 500 genera of ornamental plants grown outdoors, under glass, or in the home.

This is a beautiful production, and it includes a final chapter newly translated from the Persian by Omid Safi and Zia Inayat Khan.</p><p>Text: English, Persian (translation)</p><h2>The Woman in White</h2><p>The mysterious apparition of a woman in white leads a young drawing master on a tantalizing quest into love, mystery, danger, and evil</p><p>"There in the middle of the broad, bright high-road-there, as if it had that moment sprung out of the earth or dropped from the heaven-stood the figure of a solitary woman, dressed from head to foot in white garments." Thus young Walter Hartright first meets the mysterious woman in white in what soon became one of the most popular novels of the nineteenth century. Secrets, mistaken identities, surprise revelations, amnesia, locked rooms and locked asylums, and an unorthodox villain made this mystery thriller an instant success when it first appeared in 1860, and it has continued to enthrall readers ever since. From the hero's foreboding before his arrival at Limmeridge House to the nefarious plot concerning the beautiful Laura, the breathtaking tension of Collin's narrative created a new literary genre of suspense fiction, which profoundly shaped the course of English popular writing. Collins other great mystery, <i>The Moonstone</i>, has been called the finest detective story ever written, but it was this work that so gripped the imagination of the world that Wilkie Collins had his own tombstone inscribed: "Author of <i>The Woman In White</i>. . . "On a lonely moonlit road, a young drawing teacher meets a mysterious woman, dressed all in white, only to be struck by her eerie resemblance to his pupil, the beautiful heiress Laura Fairlie. Who is this ghostly woman in white? And what secret does she hold over Sir Percival Glyde, Laura s sinister fianc�? This gripping dramatization of the classic Victorian suspense novel opens in a London courtroom, where an inquiry into Laura s suspicious death is underway. As various characters recount the weeks leading up to her marriage and sudden illness, Collins s chilling tale of love, greed, and insanity springs to life with the aid of a brilliant cast, including Stratford Festival star Douglas Campbell as the diabolical Count Fosco.</p><h2>Saxon Advanced Math: Homeschool Kit Second Edition</h2><p>Saxon math programs produce confident students who are not only able to correctly compute, but also to apply concepts to new situations. These materials gently develop concepts, and the practice of those concepts is extended over a considerable period of time. This is called &#34;incremental development and continual review.&#34; Material is introduced in easily understandable pieces (increments), allowing students to grasp one facet of a concept before the next one is introduced. Both facets are then practiced together until another one is introduced. This feature is combined with continual review in every lesson throughout the year. Topics are never dropped but are increased in complexity and practiced every day, providing the time required for concepts to become totally familiar. Advanced Mathematics, second edition is made up of five instructional components: Introduction of the New Increment, Examples with complete Solutions, Practice of the Increment, Daily Problem Set, and Cumulative Tests. In Advanced Mathematics, topics from algebra, geometry, trigonometry, discrete mathematics, and mathematical analysis are interwoven to form a fully integrated text. A rigorous treatment of Euclidean geometry is also presented. Word problems are developed throughout the problem sets and become progressively more elaborate. With this practice, students will be able to solve challenging problems such as rate problems and work problems involving abstract quantities. A graphing calculator is used to graph functions and perform data analysis. Conceptually-oriented problems that prepare students for college entrance exams (such as the ACT and SAT) are included in the problem sets. This set contains a student text, answer key and test forms. A solutions manual is sold separately. Grade 11.</p><p></p><h2>Introduction to Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy</h2><p>Now in its third edition, this classic text covers many aspects of infrared and Raman spectroscopy that are critical to the chemist doing structural or compositional analysis. This work includes practical and theoretical approaches to spectral interpretation as well as a discussion of experimental techniques. Emphasis is given to group frequencies, which are studied in detailed discussions, extensive tables, and over 600 carefully chosen and interpreted spectral examples. Also featured is a unique treatment of group frequencies that stresses their mechanical origin. This qualitative approach to vibrational analysis helps to simplify spectral interpretation.<br>Additional topics include basic instrumental components and sampling techniques, quantitative analysis, Raman polarization data, infrared gas contours, and polarized IR studies, among others.<ul><li>Focuses on group frequency correlations and how to use them in spectral interpretation</li><li>Revised and updated by a pioneer in the field, Norman Colthup, who for thirty years has served as an expert lecturer for the Fisk Infrared Institute</li><li>Explores new group frequency studies in aromatics, alkanes and olefins, among others</li><li>Includes completely updated section on instrumentation</li></ul></p><p>This desk reference, necessary for every practicing spectroscopist, represents the first definitive book written specifically to integrate knowledge about group frequencies in infrared as well as Raman spectra. In addition to detailing characteristic group frequencies of compounds from a comprehensive assortment of categories, the book includes a collection of spectra and a literature search conducted to verify existing correlations and to determine ways to enhance correlations between vibrational frequencies and molecular structure. Particular attention has been given to the correlation between Raman characteristic frequencies and molecular structure. Displaying infrared and Raman spectra and listing frequencies along with succinct, descriptive text, this handbook will provide a much needed reference for practicing vibrational spectroscopists in academia and industry.<p>"This book is indeed a classic, very useful, and well worth updating." --<b>Clara D. Craver, President, CHEMIR LABORATORIES</b></p> <p>"The primary objective of this book is to convey the rules and correlations to the novice and to those of us who have an occasional need for interpreting spectra. However, it is also an excellent reference for those more experienced in interpretation....The newest edition contains some useful improvements over the earlier ones....The emphasis is still on IR; however, Raman plays a larger role and some nice examples are presented....I have emphasized the spectral interpretation aspects of the book, but it contains much more. In fact, it has all of the ingredients for an excellent introductory text on IR (and Raman) spectroscopy....This book should be on the desk of every spectroscopist and everyone involved with IR and Raman spectra of organic molecules. In addition, it is a great starting place for anyone interested in learning about vibrational spectroscopy." --<b><i>ANALYTICAL CHEMISTY</i></b></p> <p>"This is a current and relevant text dealing with the very important field of spectral correlation methods in vibrational spectroscopy. The quality of this text is not surprising, since Norm Colthup is the father of this field. At American Cyanamid, he did much of the basic work correlating infrared frequencies with functional groups, and he remains the most expert person I know in the interpretation of infrared spectra." --<b>Robert G. Messerschmidt, President, CONNECTICUT INSTRUMENT CORPORATION</b></p> <p>"The third edition of <i>Introduction to Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy</i><b>,</b> like the two previous editions, is a book that every vibrational spectroscopist should have as a reference." --<b><i>SPECTROSCOPY</i></b></p></p><h2>BIG IDEAS MATH: Resource by Chapter &amp; Assessment Book Advanced 1</h2><p>(Please read this volume by the publisher only includes chapters 11-15.

However, it is much shorter and is exclusively directed toward an undergraduate audience. Teachers and students will find the list of important concepts and terms in each chapter a helpful guide, and will appreciate the radically different dynamic figures and lively photographs. The content of all chapters has been updated, and material has been reorganized into new chapters such as &#34;Conflict and Cooperation&#34; and &#34;How To Be Fit.&#34; Contributors Scott V.

Maillart set off on an epic journey from Geneva to Kabul with fellow writer Annemarie Schwarzenbach in a brand new Ford. As the first European women to travel alone on Afghanistan&#x2019;s Northern Road, Maillart and Schwarzenbach had a rare glimpse of life in Iran and Afghanistan at a time when their borders were rarely crossed by Westerners. As the two flash across Europe and the Near East in a streak of �lan and daring, Maillart writes of comical mishaps, breathtaking landscapes, vitriolic religious clashes, and the ingenuity with which the women navigated what was often a dangerous journey. In beautiful, clear-eyed prose, <i>The Cruel Way</i> shows Maillart&#x2019;s great ability to explore and experience other cultures in writing both lyrical and deeply empathetic.</p> <p><br> While the core of the book is the journey itself and their interactions with people oppressed by political conflict and poverty, towards the end of the trip the women&#x2019;s increasingly troubled relationship takes center stage. By then the glamorous, androgynous Schwarzenbach, whose own account of the trip can be found in <i>All the Roads Are Open</i>, is fighting a losing battle with her own drug addiction, and Maillart&#x2019;s frustrated attempts to cure her show the profound depth of their relationship.</p> <p><br> Complete with thirteen of Maillart&#x2019;s own photographs from the journey, <i>The Cruel Way</i> is a classic of travel writing, and its protagonists are as gripping and fearless as any in literature.</p> <p></p></p><p><b>Ella K. Maillart </b>(1903&#x2013;97) was a Swiss journalist, photographer, and adventurer. She is the author of <i>Gypsy Afloat</i>, <i>The Forbidden Journey</i>, <i>Turkestan Solo</i>, and many other works published in English, French, and German.<br><p><i>&nbsp;</i>&#x201c;Ella K. Maillart&#x2014;it is she who matters, though her capital I&#x2019;s are few. The picture of herself is better than many superb photographs: a woman of the twentieth century, with a nostalgia for the primitive; always hungry for new places and new people, but sufficient to herself."</p> (<i>Pacific Affairs</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;We need [Maillart] to challenge what we think the story of two women traveling in the East can do.&nbsp;We need her to disrupt our detachment. . . . What she has found is a world of beauty and hope, a world worth going out into.&#x201d; (<i>Jessa Crispin, editor-in-chief of Bookslut</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Her descriptions and observations shine with intelligence and beauty. . . .

This apparently simple question frames <i>Spent Cartridges of Revolution,</i> an anthropological history of Namiquipa, Chihuahua, Mexico. Officially, the revolution of 1910-20 restored control over land and local politics to the peasantry. But Namiquipan peasants, who fought alongside Pancho Villa, have seen little progress and consider themselves mere "spent cartridges" of a struggle that benefited other classes.<br> <br> Daniel Nugent's approach combines an emphasis on peasants' own perceptions of Mexican society after the revolution with an analysis of the organization and formation of state power. He shows that popular discontent in Chihuahua is motivated not only by immediate economic crises but by two centuries of struggle between the people of Northern Mexico and the government.</p></p><p></p><h2>Don Juan: and Other Plays (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Moliere&#39;s prose plays demonstrate both his versatility as a playwright and the reasons for his enduring popularity from the France of Louis XIV to the present.</p><p>Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, better known as Moliere, was a French theatre writer, director and actor, one of the masters of comic satire.</p><h2>Mathematics, Magic and Mystery</h2><p>Famed puzzle expert explains math behind a multitude of mystifying tricks: card tricks, stage &#34;mind reading,&#34; coin and match tricks, counting out games, geometric dissections, etc. Probability, sets, theory of numbers clearly explained. Also, more than 400 tricks, guaranteed to work, that you can do. 135 illustrations.</p><p>Why do card tricks work?&nbsp;How can magicians do astonishing feats of mathematics mentally? Why do stage "mind-reading" tricks work? As a rule, we simply accept these tricks and "magic" without recognizing that they are&nbsp;really demonstrations of strict laws based on probability, sets, number&nbsp;theory, topology, and other branches of mathematics.This is the first book-length study of this fascinating branch of recreational mathematics. Written by one of the foremost experts on mathematical magic, it employs considerable historical data&nbsp;to summarize all previous work in this field. It is also a creative examination of laws and their exemplification, with scores of new tricks, insights, and demonstrations. Dozens of topological tricks are explained, and dozens of manipulation tricks are aligned with mathematical law.Nontechnical, detailed, and clear, this volume contains 115 sections discussing tricks with cards, dice, coins, etc.; topological tricks with handkerchiefs, cards, etc.; geometrical vanishing effects; demonstrations with pure numbers; and dozens of other topics. You will learn how a Moebius strip works and&nbsp;how a Curry square can "prove" that the whole is not equal to the sum of its parts.No skill at sleight of hand is needed to perform the more than 500 tricks described because mathematics guarantees their success. Detailed examination of laws and their application permits you to create your own problems and effects.Martin Gardner was a renowned author who published over 70 books on subjects from science and math to poetry and religion. He also had a lifelong passion for magic tricks and puzzles. Well known for his mathematical games column in <i>Scientific American</i> and his "Trick of the Month" in <i>Physics Teacher</i> magazine, Gardner attracted a loyal following with his intelligence, wit, and imagination.<p><b>Martin Gardner: A Remembrance<br></b>The worldwide mathematical community was saddened by the death of Martin Gardner on May 22, 2010. Martin was 95 years old when he died, and had written 70 or 80 books during his long lifetime as an author. Martin's first Dover books were published in 1956 and 1957: <i>Mathematics, Magic and Mystery,</i> one of the first popular books on the intellectual excitement of mathematics to reach a wide audience, and <i>Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science,</i> certainly one of the first popular books to cast a devastatingly skeptical eye on the claims of pseudoscience and the many guises in which the modern world has given rise to it. Both of these pioneering books are still in print with Dover today along with more than a dozen other titles of Martin's books. They run the gamut from his elementary <i>Codes, Ciphers and Secret Writing,</i> which has been enjoyed by generations of younger readers since the 1980s, to the more demanding <i>The New Ambidextrous Universe: Symmetry and Asymmetry from Mirror Reflections to Superstrings,</i> which Dover published in its final revised form in 2005. </p><p></p><p>To those of us who have been associated with Dover for a long time, however, Martin was more than an author, albeit a remarkably popular and successful one. As a member of the small group of long-time advisors and consultants, which included NYU's Morris Kline in mathematics, Harvard's I. Bernard Cohen in the history of science, and MIT's J. P. Den Hartog in engineering, Martin's advice and editorial suggestions in the formative 1950s helped to define the Dover publishing program and give it the point of view which &#x2014; despite many changes, new directions, and the consequences of evolution &#x2014; continues to be operative today. </p><p><b></b></p><p><b>In the Author's Own Words:<br></b>"Politicians, real-estate agents, used-car salesmen, and advertising copy-writers are expected to stretch facts in self-serving directions, but scientists who falsify their results are regarded by their peers as committing an inexcusable crime. Yet the sad fact is that the history of science swarms with cases of outright fakery and instances of scientists who unconsciously distorted their work by seeing it through lenses of passionately held beliefs." </p><p></p><p>"A surprising proportion of mathematicians are accomplished musicians.

If he were to look for the first blueberry flowers in Concord today, mid-May would be too late. In the 160 years since Thoreau&#x2019;s writings, warming temperatures have pushed blueberry flowering three weeks earlier, and in 2012, following a winter and spring of record-breaking warmth, blueberries began flowering on April 1&#x2015;six weeks earlier than in Thoreau&#x2019;s time. The climate around Thoreau&#x2019;s beloved Walden Pond is changing, with visible ecological consequences.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In <i>Walden Warming</i>, Richard B. Primack uses Thoreau and Walden, icons of the conservation movement, to track the effects of a warming climate on Concord&#x2019;s plants and animals. Under the attentive eyes of Primack, the notes that Thoreau made years ago are transformed from charming observations into scientific data sets. Primack finds that many wildflower species that Thoreau observed&#x2015;including familiar groups such as irises, asters, and lilies&#x2015;have declined in abundance or have disappeared from Concord. Primack also describes how warming temperatures have altered other aspects of Thoreau&#x2019;s Concord, from the dates when ice departs from Walden Pond in late winter, to the arrival of birds in the spring, to the populations of fish, salamanders, and butterflies that live in the woodlands, river meadows, and ponds.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Primack demonstrates that climate change is already here, and it is affecting not just Walden Pond but many other places in Concord and the surrounding region. Although we need to continue pressuring our political leaders to take action, Primack urges us each to heed the advice Thoreau offers in <i>Walden</i>: to &#x201c;live simply and wisely.&#x201d; In the process, we can each minimize our own contributions to our warming climate.</p><p><b>Richard B. Primack </b>is professor of biology at Boston University. He is the author of <i>Essentials of Conservation Biology</i> and <i>A Primer of Conservation Biology</i> and coauthor of <i>Tropical Rain Forests: An Ecological and Biogeographical Comparison</i>. He lives in Newton, Massachusetts.&#x201c;Determined to help the public understand global warming, Primack decided to search for evidence of climate change in Concord, Massachusetts, home of Walden Pond, made famous by pioneering environmentalist Henry David Thoreau. Primack&#x2019;s plan was to compare field notes of the past with new information about the same plants in the same places, but he despaired of finding reliable old records until he learned about Thoreau&#x2019;s unpublished, little-known tables precisely documenting the annual flowering dates for more than 300 plant species. Primack also struck gold in the form of invaluable nature journals kept by modern-day citizen scientists. He now tells the deeply instructive story of the challenges he and his dedicated graduate students faced during the past decade as they identified the many plants that have disappeared since Thoreau&#x2019;s time and those which &#x201c;are flowering earlier in successive years&#x201d; as spring temperatures rise. Primack shares striking tales from the field and elucidates from an unnervingly close-to-home perspective the dynamics and impact of climate change on plants, birds, and myriad other species, including us.&#x201d; (Donna Seaman <i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>"This book is more than a clarion testament to the real and present effects of climate change. It is an exhortation to become more engaged in the natural world whether through citizen science or observation, and, in so doing, recognize and limit our own impacts on the earth. A constant presence throughout this book, Thoreau would be pleased to read this volume, which weaves together science, nature, ethics, and human action as part of a single whole." (<i>Science</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Primack&#x2019;s book brings the issue of climate change down to earth in a focused approach without hard science; recommended to students of environmental studies as well as to general readers active in the study of the subject.&#x201d; (Susan E. Brazer <i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Each chapter of this book documents alarming change: the flowering of the pink lady&#x2019;s slipper orchid has begun three weeks earlier; wild apple blossoms have advanced by two to four weeks; wood sorrel by six weeks. . . . [<i>Walden Warming</i>] show[s] compellingly how a place and its ecosystems can alter dramatically in the face of climate change.&#x201d; (Jules Pretty, University of Essex <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The book tells the story of Primack&#x2019;s struggle to replicate Thoreau and find changes in flowering times, but soon broadens into a hymn to citizen science. Primack finds many others who are not conventional scientists but keep careful records of myriad things, from the times that migratory birds arrive to the date butterflies emerge and ice melts on ponds. It is these extraordinary people who make the book a rich, rewarding read. And there is also the inspiring message that anyone with a keen eye for nature can make a difference, with an afterword on how to become a citizen scientist.&#x201d; (Alun Anderson <i>New Scientist</i>)<br><br>"Primack&#x2019;s story is worth telling, and Primack is a worthy storyteller. . . . Primack clearly demonstrates the value of several non-traditional forms of historical observations for documenting change, including personal journals, butterfly club observations, and fishing lodge records. Perhaps most importantly, Primack clearly demonstrates that our environment is changing rapidly, and this is undoubtedly due to anthropogenic climate change." (Theresa M. Crimmins, University of Arizona <i>Ecology</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Primack&#x2019;s elegant and eloquent scientific memoir shows how today&#x2019;s science is advancing thanks to Henry Thoreau&#x2019;s mid-nineteenth-century observations as recorded in his journal and in his almost completely unknown because unpublished charts containing years and years worth of data on first flowering, bird arrival times, and much else happening in Concord&#x2019;s natural world. Primack&#x2019;s book is important in three ways: it is a report on what global warming has already done to a much-loved bit of American space&#x2014;Walden Pond; it is a detailed warning about what we are now facing; and it is a stirring call to arms, especially to young Americans and students about how they can help. Emerson told Thoreau to keep a journal. Primack is urging people, especially young people, to keep Thoreauvian journals, not for personal reasons, but to advance our knowledge of what happens and when in the natural world we all share. This book is a grand gift, a bracing and appealing take on a difficult and complex problem. I wish I had read it when I was nineteen.&#x201d; (Robert J. Richardson Jr., author of Henry Thoreau: A Life of the Mind)<br><br>&#x201c;This is an important book that should be required reading for everyone who cares about the future of our planet, and especially for those who remain skeptical about the threats of climate change. What better place to chronicle the effects of global warming than in the cradle of the American environmental movement&#x2015;Thoreau&#x2019;s Walden Woods.&#x201d; (Don Henley)<br><br>&#x201c;Thoreau, in <i>Walden</i>, proposed a &#x2018;realometer&#x2019; to filter out prejudice and delusion. This eloquent new book fills that role for us, reminding us that global warming is not an abstract future proposition but a very profound current reality.&#x201d; (Bill McKibben, author of Oil and Honey: The Making of an Unlikely Activist)</p><h2>Juvenile Delinquency: A Sociological Approach</h2><p>This sophomore/junior level core text is intended for the juvenile delinquency course taught in criminal justice, criminology, and sociology departments at both four year and two year institutions.<br><br>Taking a sociological approach, Juvenile Delinquency, Tenth Edition, discusses delinquency as it relates to and emerges from the youth's family, neighborhood, school, peer group, social class, and overall cultural and social environment.

Few know this better than the poets who have risen to the top of their trade by sharing their emotion, opinion and art with millions of fans.Combining the poetic forces of some of today&#39;s most popular and confessional poets, this book presents poems and short stories about connection wrapped up in a most unique exercise in creative writing. Follow along as your favorite poets connect with each other; offering their poetry to the next poet who tells a story based on the concept presented to them. With contributions from Amanda Lovelace, Nikita Gill, Iain S. Thomas, Trista Mateer, Cyrus Parker, RH Swaney, Liam Ryan, Yena Sharma Purmasir, Canisia Lubrin, and Sara Bond.</p><p>The idea for this book came to me when someone said they heard poetry was the next adult colouring book, referring to the craze of the early/mid 2010s. Like other fads, the market for these books exploded, and then promptly tanked.Is poetry the next fad? For anyone in the know, it isn&#39;t. While poetry has seen a surge in sales in recent years, its popularity has been building slowly and sustainably over several years. After all, I successfully published I Wrote This For You by Iain S. Thomas in 2011 and there were several poets who achieved more widespread popularity around that time. Many young contemporary poets are gaining voices via social media and while increases may not continue at the same rate, there is enough organic momentum to sustain a new normal of higher sales in this bigger category.Social-media poetry is simply an evolution of the art form. The sharing and acceptance of online poetry is not much different than what happened with the Impressionists and the Beat Generation, who were initially eschewed by their critics. Poetry is bringing together people from all over the world, of different races, religions, identities. Well-known and new poets are having their voices heard via social media and indie- and self-publishing. These people are changing the status quo and creating a form of art that is accessible, loud, beautiful, and soft--all at the same time.This book brings together some of the most popular talents in many forms of poetry and uses their voices to raise those of not-yet-known poets. It is an exercise for all the poets to use their counterparts&#39; work to create fiction in the form of short stories. And it&#39;s a chance for poetry fans to read longer work and see their favorite poets&#39; talents all in one book.What you&#39;re about to read is the product of ten diverse and interesting people coming together. The concept and theme of the book are about connection. We seem to live in a hyper-connected world, yet we increasingly hear stories of loneliness and isolation. This book is about connecting poets with each other, connecting poetry with short fiction, and publishing stories about connection and/or a lack thereof.By bringing together some of the most popular contemporary poets, <b>Michelle Halket</b> has created a compilation which exemplifies the reasons behind the popularity of short fiction.

What begins as a deeply personal chronicle of the Holocaust in his mother's hometown of Buchach--in former Eastern Galicia--carries him on a journey across the region and back through history. This poignant travelogue reveals the complete erasure of the Jews and their removal from public memory, a blatant act of forgetting done in the service of a fiercely aggressive Ukrainian nationalism.</p><br><p> Bartov, a leading Holocaust scholar, discovers that to make sense of the heartbreaking events of the war, he must first grapple with the complex interethnic relationships and conflicts that have existed there for centuries. Visiting twenty Ukrainian towns, he recreates the histories of the vibrant Jewish and Polish communities who once lived there-and describes what is left today following their brutal and complete destruction. Bartov encounters Jewish cemeteries turned into marketplaces, synagogues made into garbage dumps, and unmarked burial pits from the mass killings. He bears witness to the hastily erected monuments following Ukraine's independence in 1991, memorials that glorify leaders who collaborated with the Nazis in the murder of Jews. He finds that the newly independent Ukraine-with its ethnically cleansed and deeply anti-Semitic population--has recreated its past by suppressing all memory of its victims.</p><br><p> Illustrated with dozens of hauntingly beautiful photographs from Bartov's travels, <i>Erased</i> forces us to recognize the shocking intimacy of genocide.</p></p><p><p>"The Jews of East Galicia were obliterated twice: physically by the Nazis, and in memory by the Soviets and in independent Ukraine.

DSUtne Reader</p><p>"Happiness and suffering are dependent upon your mind, upon your interpretation. They do not come from outside, from others. All of your happiness and all of your suffering are created by you, by your own mind." <p>Commenting on a 13th-century Tibetan text of instructions and practical advice for everyday spiritual living, Lama Zopa Rinpoche literally teaches us how to be happy when we are not, by bringing about the changes in attitude that permit us to live a happy and relaxed life in which external circumstances no longer rule us. In Transforming Problems Into Happiness, Lama Zopa Rinpoche brings his own special flavor or contemporary relevance to a timeless teaching n Buddhist psychology. This volume will be valuable to everyone, whatever their religious of spiritual background.</p>Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche is the Spiritual Director of the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT), a worldwide network of Buddhist centers, monasteries, and affiliated projects, including Wisdom Publications. Rinpoche was born in 1946 in the village of Thami in the Solo Khumbu region of Nepal near Mount Everest. His books include <i>Transforming Problems into Happiness, How to Be Happy</i>, and <i>Ultimate Healing</i>. He lives in Aptos, California.<br> <br>Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, is the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. He frequently describes himself as a simple Buddhist monk. Born in northeastern Tibet in 1935, he was as a toddler recognized as the incarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and brought to Tibet's capital, Lhasa. In 1950, Mao Zedong's Communist forces made their first incursions into eastern Tibet, shortly after which the young Dalai Lama assumed the political leadership of his country. He passed his scholastic examinations with honors at the Great Prayer Festival in Lhasa in 1959, the same year Chinese forces occupied the city, forcing His Holiness to escape to India. There he set up the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, working to secure the welfare of the more than 100,000 Tibetan exiles and prevent the destruction of Tibetan culture. In his capacity as a spiritual and political leader, he has traveled to more than sixty-two countries on six continents and met with presidents, popes, and leading scientists to foster dialogue and create a better world. In recognition of his tireless work for the nonviolent liberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. In 2012, he relinquished political authority in his exile government and turned it over to democratically elected representatives.<br> <br>His Holiness frequently states that his life is guided by three major commitments: the promotion of basic human values or secular ethics in the interest of human happiness, the fostering of interreligious harmony, and securing the welfare of the Tibetan people, focusing on the survival of their identity, culture, and religion. As a superior scholar trained in the classical texts of the Nalanda tradition of Indian Buddhism, he is able to distill the central tenets of Buddhist philosophy in clear and inspiring language, his gift for pedagogy imbued with his infectious joy. Connecting scientists with Buddhist scholars, he helps unite contemplative and modern modes of investigation, bringing ancient tools and insights to bear on the acute problems facing the contemporary world. His efforts to foster dialogue among leaders of the world's faiths envision a future where people of different beliefs can share the planet in harmony. Wisdom Publications is proud to be the premier publisher of the Dalai Lama's more serious and in-depth works.</p><h2>Food and Feasting in Art (A Guide to Imagery)</h2><p>Deliciously illustrated with masterpieces of western art, this latest volume in the Guide to Imagery series explores the rituals, customs, and symbolism of food and dining.&nbsp;<br>The book describes the significance of food and feasts as told in scripture and in the lives of the saints; food and dining in Greek and Roman mythology and in later literature and history; and how artists through the ages have created allegories of gluttony and odes to the sense of taste, using, for example, artfully positioned fruits and vegetables in the golden age of the painted still life.&nbsp;<br>Also discussed is the role of table settings in relation to such ceremonies as formal dinners and royal banquets.

Nonfiction that reads like a thriller&#x2014;not to be missed."<b><i>&nbsp;&#x2014;School Library Journal, starred review&nbsp;</i></b><br><br>* Jarrow concludes her Deadly Diseases trilogy with a harrowing, in-depth exploration of the reappearance of bubonic plague at the turn of the 20th century.... her gripping narrative balances the clock-racing work of scientists and officials attempting to understand and stop the plague with entwined themes of fear, prejudice, and anger.... Extensively researched, with numerous resources for readers looking to study the topic further."&nbsp;<b><i>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly,&nbsp;</i>starred review</b><br><br>"Jarrow looks at plague throughout history and medical research into its causes, before zeroing in on its resurgence in the late nineteenth century, when it arose in Asia and reached Honolulu.... Thoroughly researched and clearly presented, the text offers a direct window into the period. The intertwined themes of prejudice against Asian Americans, public health officials hampered by politicians, and mistrust of scientific research... make the story complex, revealing a good deal about human nature as well as the period and the disease itself.... An informative book on an unusual topic."&nbsp;<b><i>&#x2014;Booklist&nbsp;</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The bubonic plague, or Black Death, seems conveniently trapped in history books, confined to Europe in the Middle Ages, where it famously killed a good portion of the population. In her third and final book in the Deadly Diseases trilogy (Red Madness, 2014; Fatal Fever, rev. 3/15), Jarrow covers that territory quickly before bringing us into the nineteenth century, where the plague continued to rear its ugly head in places like Hong Kong, Bombay (Mumbai), Honolulu, and finally San Francisco--where it first appeared in Chinatown in 1900.... Jarrow's treatment here is once again thorough and fascinating... an exemplary contribution to the genre of the history of science and medicine.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>&#x2014;The Horn Book</i></b></p><h2>Amateur Astronomer&#39;s Handbook (Dover Books on Astronomy)</h2><p>Timeless, comprehensive coverage of telescopes, mirrors, lenses, mountings, telescope drives, micrometers, spectroscopes, more.

Volume IV attempts to understand the men who managed the empire, their priorities and visions as leaders, and the mechanisms of control which held the empire together. There are chapters on imperial centers of activity, on the geographical periphery of the empire, and on the entirety of its connecting mechanisms, including institutions and the flow of people, money, goods, and services. Contributors also explore the experiences of Britain's imperial subjects in culture, politics, and economics--those experiences which fostered the growth of vibrant, and often new, national identities and movements as well as--ultimately--new nation-states.

In all but one of the extant Sophoclean dramas, a heroic figure who is compounded of the same literary elements faced a situation which is essentially the same. The demonstration of this recurrent pattern is made not through character-analysis, but through a close examination of the language employed by both the hero and those with whom he contends. The two chapters attempt to present what might, with a slight exaggeration, be called the "formula" of Sophoclean tragedy.<br><br>A great artist may repeat a structural pattern but he never really repeats himself. In the remaining four chapters, a close analysis of three plays, the <i>Antigone, </i><i>Philoctetes,</i> and <i>Oedipus at Colonus,</i> emphasizes the individuality and variety of the living figures Sophocles created on the same basic armature. <br><br>This approach to Sophoclean drama is (as in the author's previous work on the subject) both historical and critical; the universal and therefore contemporary appeal of the plays is to be found not by slighting or dismissing their historical context, but by an attempt to understand it all in its complexity.

The topic selection is comprehensive, covering the entire perioperative period. The chapters are well written in a concise outline layout with highlighted key points, allowing for easy accessibility while providing considerable depth of information. The discussions of the anatomy and physiology at the foundation of anesthesia practice are helpful. Excellent illustrations complement the text and are especially valuable in areas such as monitoring and regional anesthesia. Overall, this is an excellent pocket reference on all aspects of perioperative practice. The expansion of medical knowledge dictates the need for new editions. This is an essential tool for the professional development of any anesthesia practitioner.

Accordingly, a great deal of talent and imagination has been lavished on its appearance and placement. Buttons have always reflected the tastes of the times. They display the shifting movements in fashion, materials, and manufacturing techniques. From the humble to the extravagant, buttons reveal the humor, artistry, and motivation of their makers and wearers. Buttons have become highly desirable collectibles. In this beautifully illustrated guide, Nancy Fink and Maryalice Ditzler trace the historical background of the button, from classical times to the present day. Hundreds of buttons from all over the world are presented and categorized according to materials: Fabric and Cloth, Metal, Glass, Ceramic, Enamel, Natural Materials, and Plastic. Separate chapters describe uniform buttons and other button collectibles. Because most items presented in this practical guide are within reach of collectors, Buttons: A Collectors Guide will encourage you to embark on a collecting venture of your own.</p><p>Over 600 buttons from the 18th century to recent decades are pictured here in full color; they are classified by material (fabric, metal, glass, etc.) and described in terms of their history and characteristics. A section on uniform buttons has a primarily British focus, which will disappoint enthusiasts of U.S. Civil War buttons. The authors, both officeholders in several button collectors' organizations, have essentially produced a low-budget version of Diana Epstein and Millicent Safro's handsome Buttons ( LJ 2/15/92).

Button collectors Fink and Ditzler are knowledgeable and enthusiastic, easily convincing readers that buttons are little gems of design ingenuity that transform mere fasteners into miniature objets d'art. The authors discuss the history of button design and fashion and explain various methods of construction, from the exquisite craftsmanship of French and Italian buttonmakers, to the wonders of sophisticated mass production. The hundreds of buttons displayed and chronicled are organized by materials, including buttons made out of fabric and cloth, metal, glass, ceramic, enamel, plastic, and pearl as well as bone, wood, and other natural materials. Styles range from classic elegance to flashy silliness, but all are made with skill and flourish. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Saint Jerome in the Renaissance (The Johns Hopkins Symposia in Comparative History, 13)</h2><p>Just as they aspired to revive the Greek and Roman past, so the humanist scholars of the Renaissance sought to retrieve the early Christian era. Among the most fully studied figures of Christian antiquity was Saint Jerome. Eugene Rice&#39;s award-winning book traces the saint&#39;s changing images and fortunes from 1300 to 1600 and charts how culture-- popular and elite, secular and sacred, pietistic and scholarly-- celebrated those aspects of Jerome&#39;s life that best suited its own purposes.</p><p><p>"An invaluable reference guide for scholars in all fields who seek a contextual analysis of Renaissance references to the Saint."</p> (<i>Journal of Religion</i>)<br><br><p>"An important and beautiful book."</p> (Charles Trinkaus, University of Michigan)</p><h2>Bacon: Portraits and Self-Portraits</h2><p>From tormented self-images to brutal portrayals of friends and fellow artists, the portraits of Francis Bacon account for one of the most remarkable aspects of the work of this great British painter. His stylistic distortions of classicism and his famous deformations have changed the traditional genre of portraiture more drastically than the work of any other artist of the twentieth century. Originally published on the occasion of a major retrospective at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, Bacon: Portraits and Self-Portraits is the first book dedicated to this aspect of his work. Milan Kundera, the famed Czech novelist, provides a perceptive introduction explaining his personal response to Bacon&#39;s work, exploring the paradox that lies in the faithfulness of the distorted images, and likening Bacon&#39;s genius to that of Samuel Beckett, both working at the outer limits of their art. An important essay by art historian France Borel sets Bacon&#39;s works in the context of his life and influences and explains his approach to portraiture. With superb reproductions of more than 130 studies and portraits, including those of Lucian Freud, George Dyer, Mick Jagger, and Isabel Rawsthorne, Bacon: Portraits and Self-Portraits offers new insight into these radical and disturbing images. Many details are included, revealing for the first time the varied textures of Bacon&#39;s paint surface.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchThese two books enrich the already substantial Bacon bibliography with different but equally successful approaches. While Peppiatt's biography fleshes out, with lucidity and scholarship, biographical and contextual details heretofore unexplored, Bacon: Portraits and Self-Portraits is a lavishly produced treat with a sharp focus, carefully chosen reproductions, and inspired writing. Peppiatt (editor of Art International) brings both a critical and a personal perspective to his subject, as he was a close friend of the artist. Bacon's haunting images almost beg for psychological exploration; likewise, one is tempted to search for elements of the artist's hidden, exceptional life (and lifestyle) in his work. The new information Peppiatt provides about Bacon's early years enlarges the already complex portrait of the artist, and the interplay of persona and paintings adds up to a compelling and readable study. Bacon: Portraits and Self-Portraits is composed of Bacon's representations of people?ranging from Lucian Freud to Mick Jagger?with many details and photographs that unveil the remarkable likenesses retained in studies that on the surface are gross distortions. Kundera's essay explores links with Picasso and Beckett and is wonderfully perceptive, while Belgian art historian Borel's prose is provocative?albeit a bit ponderous, possibly in part because of the translation. Both titles are highly recommended for 20th-century art collections, although the latter is more of a luxury.?Heidi Martin Winston, <br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Italian: Level 1 (Learn in Your Car) (Italian Edition)</h2><p>Listeners learn pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar of a new language without the need of a textbook. Convenient to use while driving, working out... or anywhere!</p><p>Look ma, no textbooks! The Learn in Your Car series treats you like a child--in the best possible way--starting with one-word phrases (&#34;please,&#34; &#34;good-by&#34;), counting exercises, and simple nouns (&#34;bus,&#34; &#34;train&#34;) designed to imitate a child&#39;s learning process. First you hear the words in English, then they are repeated slowly in clear, unaccented pronunciations. The method is extremely effective for those who don&#39;t know a thing, or for those who want to brush up by testing themselves when the English words are spoken. The tapes emphasize the building blocks of communicating in a foreign country rather than rote phrases that only apply on the tape and not in real-life exchanges. Level 1 painlessly covers basic verb forms, essential prepositions, near future and past tenses, as well as shopping, hotel reservations, and other travel-related situations. The series includes French, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, and Spanish in three levels that can be purchased individually or in boxed sets. Each level contains two 90-minute cassettes (or CDs) and an accompanying booklet (not for use behind the wheel) with helpful explanations and scripts for the lessons.</p><h2>The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure, 4th Edition</h2><p>Already the acclaimed choice of thousands of successful organizations including the American Library Association, the Fourth Edition features an all-new chapter that considers the ways the Internet and other state-of-the-art technologies have rewritten the rules of today&#x2019;s meetings and conventions.

Tracing the history of homelessness from the Middle Ages to present-day America, Miller focuses on society's attitude toward tran sients, which sometimes romanticized their free spirit life but more often considered them morally flawed. Modern homelessness was more extensively covered in Peter Rossi's Down and Out in America ( LJ 11/1/89), while Jonathan Kozol provided personal accounts of the homeless and an agenda for reform in his Rachel and Her Children ( LJ 3/15/88). Still, this title is recommended as a worthwhile contribution to the history of attitudes toward the dispossessed in America.

This work provides an overview of current approaches as well as practical guidelines for their use in software design. It builds a conceptual and terminological base and goes on to discuss how design patterns constitute a minimal yet sufficient means to meet the goal of capturing and communicating the design of complex object-oriented systems.</p><p><i>Pattern Languages of Program Design</i> is the first of three volumes of groundbreaking research on patterns, ranging from smaller-scale design patterns to larger patterns useful for software architecture and process engineering. Early chapters look at frameworks and components for engineering solutions to particular types of problems at a higher level, such as looking at patterns as "tools and materials" that can be used to solve problems effectively. The guide also discusses how to use patterns with interpreters and client-server systems. <p> Distributed processing is a difficult and exciting area of computing, and patterns presented in <i>Pattern Languages of Program Design</i> can help solve some of the problems of scalability, concurrency, and transaction management. These patterns include several business objects for managing transactions and accounts, as well as for optimizing queries across distributed systems. </p><p> The middle section of this text applies patterns to the software engineering process itself and several papers (including one intriguingly called "Caterpillar's Fate") show how the pattern movement can benefit software engineers and managers. Further material looks at the process of defining and implementing patterns. (Discovering patterns is only a start; learning to reuse them effectively is another challenge.) Final chapters look at patterns that manage state and events for real-time and behavioral systems. </p><p> Although the first installment of <i>Pattern Language of Program Design</i> offers a decidedly mixed bag of essays, it is particularly strong on distributed systems and provides a strong overview of some central thinking on pattern research, which is still relevant. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p><p> </p><blockquote> <p>The first conference on Pattern Languages of Program Design (PLoP)was a watershed event that gave a public voice to the software designpattern movement. Seventy software professionals from around theworld worked together to capture and refine software experience thatexemplifies the elusive quality called "good design." This volume isthe result of that work--a broad compendium of this new genre ofsoftware literature.</p> <p>Patterns are a literary form that take inspiration from literateprogramming, from a design movement of the same name in contemporaryarchitecture, and from the practices common to the ageless literatureof any culture. The goal of pattern literature is to help programmersresolve the common difficult problems encountered in design andprogramming. Spanning disciplines as broad as client/serverprogramming, distributed processing, organizational design, softwarereuse, and human interface design, this volume encodes designexpertise that too often remains locked in the minds of expertarchitects. By capturing these expert practices as problem-solutionpairs supported with a discussion of the forces that shape alternativesolution choices, and rationales that clarify the architects' intents,these patterns convey the essence of great software designs.</p> <br> <br> 0201607344B04062001 <p></p></blockquote></p><h2>Night: Sparknotes</h2><p><b><i>Get your "A" in gear!</i></b><br><br>They're today's most popular study guides-with everything you need to succeed in school.

(<i>Intl Jnl of Electrical Engineering Education</i>, Vol 41(1))</p><h2>The Fall of Interpretation: Philosophical Foundations for a Creational Hermeneutic</h2><p>Many philosophers of the past century have focused on the problem of hermeneutics. Theologians have shared this concern because of their interest in interpreting biblical texts. As postmodern critics have challenged the possibility of understanding any texts, the issue of how to respond has become acute. <p>Among myriad approaches to hermeneutics, both secular and Christian theorists have often assumed the same thing: that the need for interpretation is a lamentable, scandalous, even fallen affair. In an ideal world there would be no need for interpretation, since communication would be immediate, instantaneous and errorless. </p><p>James K. A. Smith, in this provocative book, cogently surveys contemporary hermeneutical discussion, identifying three traditions and how they understand interpretation: a present immediacy model, an eschatological immediacy model and a violent mediation model. </p><p>Questioning the foundational assumption that these models share, Smith deftly draws on and reworks Augustine's biblical understanding of the goodness of creation to propose a creational-pneumatic model of hermeneutics. In his words, such a hermeneutic "would link [Augustine's] insights on the temporality of human be-ing and language with his affirmation of the fundamental goodness of creation: the result is an understanding of the status of interpretation as a 'creational task,' a task which is constitutive of finitude and thus not a 'labor' to be escaped or overcome. Such an 'interpretation of interpretation' revalues embodiment and ultimately ends in a ethical respect for difference as the gift of a creating God who loves difference and loves differently." </p><p>"The ineluctable plurality of interpretation, both of texts and of the world, belongs to creation in its goodness and not (merely) to the Fall. That is the thesis of this bold challenge to a whole spectrum of thought, which ranges from evangelical theology to deconstructive philosophy, that finds interpretation to be inherently fallen. On the basis of an Arminian Augustinianism and a Kuyperian Calvinism, Smith sketches a creational interpretation of interpretation. Both the critique of the contemporary consensus and the constructive alternative deserve widespread discussion. The scholarship is impressive and the writing is lucid." Merold Westphal, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Fordham University </p><p>"The Fall of Interpretation represents a major contribution to the ongoing discussion between Christian theology and contemporary continental philosophy. . . . This is a brilliantly argued book from a major new voice in contemporary hermeneutical theory." John D. Caputo, David R. Cook Professor of Philosophy, Villanova University</p></p><p>James K. A.

Fanning out across the region, the fire ants invaded the South, damaging crops, harassing game animals, and hindering harvesting methods. Responding to a collective call from southerners to eliminate these invasive pests, the U.S. Department of Agriculture developed a campaign that not only failed to eradicate the fire ants but left a wake of dead wildlife, sickened cattle, and public protest.<br> <br> With political intrigue, environmental tragedy, and such figures as Rachel Carson and E. O. Wilson, <i>The Fire Ant Wars</i> is a grippingly perceptive tale of changing social attitudes and scientific practices. Tracing the political and scientific eradication campaigns, Joshua Buhs's bracing study uses the saga as a means to consider twentieth-century American concepts of nature and environmental stewardship.

Blum, author of Fundamentals of Insect Physiology)<br><br>"Joshua Buhs uses the story of the fire ants in the American South after World War Two to show just how intricate the connections between 'nature' and 'culture' were, how culture shaped what humans saw in nature, and how the ant took advantage of human disturbances in ecology of the post-war South to expand across the region." (Thomas Dunlap, author of Saving America's Wildlife: Ecology and the American Mind, 1850-1990)<br><br>"The story of the imported fire ants is an American entomological epic and a classic in the history of development versus environment. Buhs's study is thorough and will be the history of record for this subject." (Edward O. Wilson)<br><br>"Joshua Blu Buhs documents the extraordinary story of PR, public expectations, politics and panic as the pressure for the fire ant eradication campaign took hold. He describes how the excesses of the campaign altered popular perceptions of the pest and played no small part in the emergence of the grass-roots environmental movement in the US. He shows how the balance of bureaucracy and power shifted, and indeed still shifts, from the eradicators to the environmentalists and back." (Gaden S. Robinson <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2005-04-01)<br><br><p>"Buhs had access to a vast amount of unpublished archival material in private and public collections, so that his book must be considered the definitive historical account of the 'fire ant wars'. . . . What really sets this book apart is the historical detail Buhs provides of interactions among federal bureaucracies, universities, individual scientists, and the American public. . . .

Feener <i>Ecology</i>)<br><br>"&nbsp;In <i>The&nbsp;Fire Ant Wars</i> Buhs has produced a clearly written, impressively&nbsp;researched, and fascinating account of the postwar campaign to&nbsp; eradicate what is perhaps the American South's most famous insect&nbsp; pest,<i>Solenopsis Invicta</i>, the imported red fire ant. The human side&nbsp;of the story is especially interesting, and where <i>The Fire Ant Wars&nbsp;</i>really shines is in its exploration of clashing scientific egos,&nbsp;<br>bureaucratic maneuvering, ruthless ecological management and the&nbsp;changing historical context that brought such management into question. . . .An excellent example of sophisticated environmental history, a book broad in its reach and&nbsp;full of nuance in its interpretations. In particular it serves as a&nbsp;focused yet inclusive case study for a number of topics&#x2014;the history&nbsp;of pesticide use and risk, the evolution of federal environmental&nbsp;policy, the role of science and scientists in environmental advocacy."

In doing so, Buhs offers a variety of &#x2018;books&#x2019; within this one work: it is a natural history of fire ants, a case study of USA environmental policy and politics, an environmental history of the American South (with both regional and transnational aspects), a glimpse into the history of USA entomology, and a blend of agricultural history and the history of science and technology, all<br>based on impressive multi-archival research. . . . Author and publisher should be applauded for including such a wealth of useful figures, photographs, and illustrations. . . .

Written entirely in non-technical language, it aims to be introductory without being elementary, so that readers may quickly engage with selected readings from classic sources. The writings of major philosophers are explained in a structured exploration of recurrently important issues about right and wrong, good and evil, social relations and religious meaning. </p> <p>This book is a radical revision of Gordon Graham&#x2019;s <em>Eight Theories of Ethics</em> (Routledge 2004). A hallmark of the new edition is the incorporation of primary readings into the text itself, making the book suitable as a stand-alone publication for any ethics course or for anyone wanting to know the history and arguments or moral philosophy. Primary sources include extracts from Aristotle, Camus, Hume, Kant, Locke, Mill, Nietzsche, Plato, Reid, and Sartre, as well as Aldo Leopold and James Lovelock. The new edition also offers extended treatment of the objective/subjective debate, social contract theory, Nietzsche on morality, recent interpretations of Kant, the relation between morality and the existence of God, and a full chapter on environmental ethics.<br></p></p><p><strong>Gordon Graham</strong> is Henry Luce III Professor of Philosophy and the Arts at Princeton Theological Seminary.</p><h2>The Women of Mexico City, 1790-1857</h2><p>This pioneering study poses three main questions: Were women&#39;s roles in this era as narrow and unimportant as has been assumed?

Every person alive today is descended from him. How did this real-life Adam wind up father of us all? What happened to the descendants of other men who lived at the same time? And why, if modern humans share a single prehistoric ancestor, do we come in so many sizes, shapes, and races?</p><br><p> Showing how the secrets about our ancestors are hidden in our genetic code, Spencer Wells reveals how developments in the cutting-edge science of population genetics have made it possible to create a family tree for the whole of humanity. We now know not only where our ancestors lived but who they fought, loved, and influenced.</p><br><p> Informed by this new science, <i>The Journey of Man</i> is replete with astonishing information. Wells tells us that we can trace our origins back to a single Adam and Eve, but that Eve came first by some 80,000 years. We hear how the male Y-chromosome has been used to trace the spread of humanity from Africa into Eurasia, why differing racial types emerged when mountain ranges split population groups, and that the San Bushmen of the Kalahari have some of the oldest genetic markers in the world. We learn, finally with absolute certainty, that Neanderthals are not our ancestors and that the entire genetic diversity of Native Americans can be accounted for by just ten individuals.</p><br><p> It is an enthralling, epic tour through the history and development of early humankind--as well as an accessible look at the analysis of human genetics that is giving us definitive answers to questions we have asked for centuries, questions now more compelling than ever.</p></p><p>Spencer Wells traces human evolution back to our very first ancestor in <i>The Journey of Man</i>. Along the way, he sums up the explosive effect of new techniques in genetics on the field of evolutionary biology and all available evidence from the fossil record. Wells's seemingly sexist title is purposeful: he argues that the Y chromosome gives us a unique opportunity to follow our migratory heritage back to a sort of Adam, just as earlier work in mitochondrial DNA allowed the identification of Eve, mother of all <i>Homo sapiens</i>. While his descriptions of the advances made by such luminary scientists as Richard Lewontin and Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza can be dry, Wells comes through with sparkling metaphors when it counts, as when he compares genetic drift to a bouillabaisse recipe handed down through a village's generations. Though finding our primal male is an exciting prospect, the real revolution Wells describes is racial. Or rather, nonracial, as he reiterates the scientific truth that our notions of what makes us different from each other are purely cultural, not based in biology. The case for an "out of Africa" scenario of human migration is solid in this book, though Wells makes it clear when he is hypothesizing anything controversial. Readers interested in a fairly technical, but not overwhelming, summary of the remarkable conclusions of 21st-century human evolutionary biology will find <i>The Journey of Man</i> a perfect primer. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><p>"Written with much verve, easy to read, and up-to-date on many important developments."<b>--Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, Stanford University, author of <i>The History and Geography of Human Genes</i> and <i>Genes, Peoples, and Languages</i>.</b></p><p>"Spencer Wells, whose genetic work has contributed to our understanding of human prehistory, has provided the lay reader with an account of the spread and mixing of the human species from its origin in Africa that is both scientifically accurate and accessible to the nonscientist. In achieving that accessibility, he has not made the common error of confusing simple explanations with simplistic ones. Most important, Wells has the intellectual integrity, all too rare in popularizations of science, to distinguish what is really known from what is only speculation."<b>--Richard Lewontin, Harvard University, author of <i>It Ain't Necessarily So: The Dream of the Human Genome and Other Illusions</i>.</b></p></p><h2>Easy Steps to Chinese3 (Workbook) (Simpilified Chinese)</h2><p>Easy Steps to Chinese Workbook Vol. 3 (English and Chinese Edition)</p><p></p><h2>Ceremony &amp; Celebration: Introduction to the Holidays</h2><p>When did Rosh HaShana, the anniversary of creation, become a day of judgement?

It&#39;s something students know and can get passionate about, and it also functions as a bridge to academic culture and concerns. THE POP CULTURE ZONE: WRITING CRITICALLY ABOUT POPULAR CULTURE, 2nd Edition, focuses on students&#39; relationship with pop culture - such as film, television, social networks, and advertisements - and how this relationship can help them become better critical thinkers, readers, and writers. Students learn to listen to viewpoints that differ from their own, summarize their views effectively, compare and contrast, and present their ideas in a way that creates a continuing conversation of ideas.</p><p>Allison D.

It is the story of a resource that has been undeniably central to the creation of our modern culture, and ever-present during the darkest exploits of empire the world over. For the past 150 years, oil has become the most essential ingredient for economic, military, and political power. And it has brought us to our present moment in which political leaders and the fossil-fuel industry consider extraordinary, and extraordinarily dangerous, policy on a world stage marked by shifting power bases.</p> <p>Upending the conventional wisdom by crafting a &#x201c;people&#x2019;s history,&#x201d; award-winning journalist Matthieu Auzanneau deftly traces how oil became a national and then global addiction, outlines the enormous consequences of that addiction, sheds new light on major historical and contemporary figures, and raises new questions about stories we thought we knew well: What really sparked the oil crises in the 1970s, the shift away from the gold standard at Bretton Woods, or even the financial crash of 2008? How has oil shaped the events that have defined our times: two world wars, the Cold War, the Great Depression, ongoing wars in the Middle East, the advent of neoliberalism, and the Great Recession, among them?</p> <p>With brutal clarity, <em>Oil, Power, and War</em> exposes the heavy hand oil has had in all of our lives&#x2015;and illustrates how much heavier that hand could get during the increasingly desperate race to control the last of the world&#x2019;s easily and cheaply extractable reserves.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Matthieu Auzanneau is the director of The Shift Project, a European think tank focusing on energy transition and the resources required to make the shift to an economy free from fossil fuel dependence, and also from greenhouse gas emissions. Previously he was a journalist, based in France, and mostly writing for <em>Le Monde</em>. He continues to write his <em>Le Monde</em> blog, <em>Oil Man</em>, which he describes as &#x201c;a chronicle of the beginning of the end of petroleum.&#x201d; The original French edition of this book, <em>Or Noir: La grande histoire du p�trole</em>, was awarded the Special Prize of the French Association of Energy Economists in 2016.&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>Richard Heinberg is Senior Fellow at the Post Carbon Institute.

Extending its narrative through the events of early 2018, it offers a profound new understanding of oil&#x2019;s role in war and peace, growth and&nbsp;stagnation; and it casts new light on the foundations of national power and the&nbsp;challenge that lies ahead.

This is a richly documented and beautifully written book, which tells a story that has not been fully told&#x2015;until now. Auzanneau masterfully reveals the vast extent to which the arteries of today&#x2019;s politics, economics, and culture have been indelibly shaped by the rise&#x2015;and decline&#x2015;of the world&#x2019;s most abundant fossil fuel. In years to come, historians will refer back to Auzanneau&#x2019;s work as a definitive guide to the real role of oil in some of the most pivotal events in world history.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Nafeez Ahmed, editor of INSURGE intelligence; visiting research fellow at the Global Sustainability Institute at Anglia Ruskin University</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Auzanneau&#x2019;s <em>Oil, Power, and War</em> is a fascinating and excellent book. It sets out in detail the extraordinary story of oil&#x2019;s discovery, production, pricing, and control, and throws light on the fears, misapprehensions, power plays, and conflicts that our addiction to this cheap and flexible form of energy has engendered. Auzanneau is particularly good at explaining the importance of oil in the sustenance of modern society, and therefore why the coming constraint to the global oil supply&#x2015;caused by the current resource-limited plateau (and soon decline) in the global production of conventional oil&#x2015;is likely to be so difficult. Hopefully lessons learned from our past mistakes, laid out so well in this book, can help guide us through the oil challenges that lie ahead.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;R. W. Bentley, editor of <em>The Oil Age</em>; author of <em>Introduction to Peak Oil</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Matthieu Auzanneau&#x2019;s book is a must for anyone who wants to understand the modern world. Our consumer society is based on cheap energy. Thus if you want to know the sources of the world&#x2019;s current wealth and how our economy is likely to evolve in the future, you must study the history of world oil since 1859. This book tells that story more fully, fairly, accurately, and entertainingly than any other to date. Indeed, previous accounts of the history of oil are now effectively obsolete.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Jean Laherr�re, petroleum engineer; president of ASPO France</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;An absolutely great book, and a nearly unbelievable summary of the history of oil. But this is not just the story of oil, it is also the story of humankind during the past two centuries or so, and it shows how almost everything that happened during those centuries links back to oil. Auzanneau presents a treasure trove of information not available anywhere else&#x2015;at least not in a well-organized and critical form, as most books written on this subject are sponsored or supported, one way or another, by the fossil-fuel industry. Did you know that Mussolini was lured into his disastrous Ethiopian campaign by hopes of finding oil there? Did you know that the British won the Battle of Britain partly because the fuel of their Spitfires had a higher octane number than that of the German Messerschmitts? Did you know that the Marshall Plan to rebuild the European economies was based on the idea of replacing Europe&#x2019;s dependence on American oil with a dependence on US-controlled Middle East oil? There&#x2019;s all this and much more in <em>Oil, Power, and War</em>, and the story of oil and humankind is not yet concluded. In the future it will be mostly about getting rid of oil before oil gets rid of us.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Ugo Bardi, author of <em>Extracted</em></strong></p></p><h2>Tao Te Ching: Liber 157 (The Equinox, Vol. 3, No. 8)</h2><p>Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) was uniquely qualified to produce a translation of Lao-tzus Tao Te Ching. He was called the finest English metrical poet of his generation by some of his contemporaries, and his work is anthologized in the Oxford Book of Mystical Verse. He was also a profound and experienced magician, mystic, and philosopher, trained in western esotericism, Hermeticism, the Qabalah and more traditional western philosophy, but with a deep and abiding interest in the ancient philosophies of the Orient. Crowley traveled widely in the East, and he actually walked across Southern China in 1906. His first-hand experience of the Orient made him one of the first students in the West to grasp oriental philosophy on its own terms, without a Eurocentric or Judeo-Christian cultural bias. The Chinese scholar Hellmut WIlhelp acknowledged the primacy of Crowleys work in Taoist studies. Crowley had no Chinese, and his translation is that of a poet interpreting the dry and scholastic translation of James Legge, as Ezra Pound would later do with the Confucian Analects. He contributes and autobiographical and critical introduction that discusses his religious philosophy and his lifelong attraction to Taoism, and his extensive notes and commentary to his translation help to amplify the meaning of the Chinese classic. This edition includes Crowleys verse translation of the Ching-ching Ching (Liber XXI, The Classic of Purity) as an appendix. This edition includes an editorial forward by Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior of O.T.O., as well as bibliography and index.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Chinese</p><h2>Let the Whole Earth Sing Praise</h2><p>This joyous book sings thanks and praise for everything in land, sea, and sky-from the sun and moon to plants and animals to all people, young and old.

With text inspired by Old Testament Scripture and artwork fashioned after the beautiful embroideries and designs of the Otomi people from the mountain villages around San Pablito, in Puebla, Mexico, this is a wonderful celebration for all to share.</p><p>Tomie dePaola was born in Meriden, Connecticut, in 1934 to a family of Irish and Italian background. By the time he could hold a pencil, he knew what his life's work would be. His determination to create books for children led to a BFA from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and an MFA from the California College of Arts &amp; Crafts in Oakland, California.<p>It drove him through the years of teaching, designing greeting cards and stage sets, and painting church murals until 1965, when he illustrated his first children's book, <i>Sound</i>, by Lisa Miller for Coward-McCann. Eventually, freed of other obligations, he plunged full time into both writing and illustrating children's books.</p><p>He names Fra Angelico and Giotto, Georges Rouault, and Ben Shahn as major influences on his work, but he soon found his own unique style. His particular way with color, line, detail, and design have earned him many of the most prestigious awards in his field, among them a Caldecott Honor Award for <i>Strega Nona</i>, the Smithsonian Medal from the Smithsonian Institution, the Kerlan Award from the University of Minnesota for his "singular attainment in children's literature," the Catholic Library Association's Regina Medal for his "continued distinguished contribution," and the University of Southern Mississippi Medallion.

The Commune of 1871 emerged after the Prussian war when the Paris militia chased the central government to Versailles, enabling the working class and its allies to seize control of the capital. Eventually violence engulfed the city as traditional liberals and moderates joined forces with reactionaries to restore Paris to "order"--the bourgeois order. Here Boime examines the rise of Impressionism in relation to the efforts of the reinstated conservative government to "rebuild" Paris, to return it to its Haussmannian appearance and erase all reminders of socialist threat.</p><br><p> Boime contends that an organized Impressionist movement owed its initiating impulse to its complicity with the state's program. The exuberant street scenes, spaces of leisure and entertainment, sunlit parks and gardens, the entire concourse of movement as filtered through an atmosphere of scintillating light and color all constitute an effort to reclaim Paris visually and symbolically for the bourgeoisie. Amply documented, richly illustrated, and compellingly argued, Boime's thesis serves as a challenge to all cultural historians interested in the rise of modernism.</p></p><p><p>"Quite stimulating--a heady mix of political and art history.

Werner Sollors's new book takes a wide-ranging look at the role of "ethnicity" in American literature and what that literature has said--and continues to say--about our diverse culture. Ethnic consciousness, he contends, is a constituent feature of modernism, not modernism's antithesis.<br> <br> Discussing works from every period of American history, Sollors focuses particularly on the tension between "descent" and "consent"--between the concern for one's racial, ethnic, and familial heritage and the conflicting desire to choose one's own destiny, even if that choice goes against one's heritage. Some of the stories Sollors examines are retellings of the biblical Exodus--stories in which Americans of the most diverse origins have painted their own histories as an escape from bondage or a search for a new Canaan. Other stories are "American-made" tales of melting-pot romance, which may either triumph in intermarriage, accompanied by new world symphonies, or end with the lovers' death. Still other stories concern voyages of self-discovery in which the hero attempts to steer a perilous course between stubborn traditionalism and total assimilation. And then there are the generational sagas, in which, as if by magic, the third generation emerges as the fulfillment of their forebears' dream.<br> <br> Citing examples that range from the writings of Cotton Mather to Liquid Sky (a "post-punk" science fiction film directed by a Russian emigre), Sollors shows how the creators of American culture have generally been attracted to what is most new and modern.<br> <br> A provocative and original look at "ethnicity" in American literature<br>�Covers stories from all periods of our nation's history<br>�Relates ethnic literature to the principle of literary modernism<br>�"Grave and hilarious, tender and merciless...The book performs a public service."-Quentin Anderson<br></p><p>Nothing is &#39;pure&#39; in America, and indeed, the rich ethnic mix that constitutes our society accounts for much of its vitality.

KAHNWEILER, <i>My Galleries and Painters</i>CHAPTER ONE<i>The Atmosphere of Propaganda</i>IA visitor to the studio at 27, rue de Fleurus in the early years of the twentieth century might well have believed he had been admitted to an entirely new form of institution--a ministry of propaganda for modern art. His knock upon the large double door that was secured by the only Yale lock in Paris's sixth <i>arrondissement</i> would have brought his hostess, a stout, impressive woman in her thirties, a woman with an imperturbable expression, a pair of frankly curious brown eyes, and a remarkable air of self-possession. Her customary response, if the visitor was not a familiar member of her circle of friends and acquaintances, would be a lax <i>"De la part de qui venez-vous?"</i> delivered in a contralto voice, the French tinged with a refined American accent.Because anyone was admitted to the weekly at homes at the rue de Fleurus, the question was a mere formality. As likely as not, however, the guest might be forced to stammer, "But by yours, Madame." For Gertrude Stein, the hostess of these Saturday evenings, which combined excited talk with an extraordinary glimpse of the most outrageous modern paintings, was frequently in the habit of meeting interesting people, inviting them to her home--and promptly forgetting that she had.The Yale lock was not for security. Although the whitewashed walls of the studio room were lined with paintings from eye level to the high ceiling--lined, tier upon tier, with stunning C�zanne oils and watercolors, with the brilliant smears of Matisse's Fauve landscapes, with the somber, brooding nudes and acrobats of Picasso's Blue and Rose Period paintings--the pictures had not acquired the astronomical values they were to have in later years. The Yale lock was a concession to Gertrude Stein's ingrained American sense of convenience. She found French keys a nuisance--too large and bothersome. The small key to her Yale lock could be dropped conveniently into her purse when she left the atelier for her usual afternoon walks. Or, it could be slipped into her pocket when she stepped out of the <i>pavillon</i>--the adjacent two-story apartment where she lived with her brother Leo--to open the studio doors for their arriving Saturday-evening guests.The paintings were the principal attraction of the Steins' at homes. In the decade before World War I, few places in Paris could provide a similar glimpse of such modern audacities. For their services in exposing modern art to a continuous stream of international visitors--eager young German students, visiting Swedes and Hungarians, wealthy American tourists--the Steins could easily have claimed the distinction of having instituted the first museum of modern art. Within a few years of their arrival in the French capital, they had put together an astounding collection of everything the tradition-bound Parisian art world considered outrageous and revolutionary--and, more often than not, hoaxes of the most deliberate kind. Among the French it was considered sport to visit the Steins at least once, just to see the incredible trash the two gullible Americans had hung on their walls.Moreover, the Steins themselves were an attraction. Open-minded, hospitable, they were both inveterate and enthusiastic talkers. Leo Stein discoursed on any subject from Picasso's painting style to the latest theories on diet, bringing to his discussion an amazing fund of odd information and queer observations. Gertrude, in those early years beginning to take herself seriously as a writer, was content to leave the aesthetic discussions to her brother Leo. She nonetheless admitted that argument was the very air she breathed. Among the assembled guests and, usually, at the center of a heated discussion, Leo cut an odd figure. He was taller and thinner than Gertrude, and his sharp profile, his straggly reddish beard and slightly balding head gave him a rabbinical appearance. He was a man of intense and antic gestures; in the middle of a conversation he would suddenly sit down and rest his feet on a bookcase, several inches above the level of his head, explaining that this was necessary for his cranky digestion.Gertrude was formidable in appearance. On Saturday evenings her ample body was usually encased in a loose-fitting hostess gown. She looked monumental; the rounded, firm volumes of her head, her massivebody seemed as if carved from stone. Even those who disliked her were struck by Gertrude's impressive bearing. Seated in one of the high-backed Renaissance chairs in the studio, her legs tucked under her Buddha-like, she gave the impression of an irresistible force disguised as an immovable object.Dressed in brother-and-sister outfits of practical brown corduroy and wearing comfortable but unconventional sandals, the Steins were familiar figures on the streets of Paris and in the city's art galleries. On many occasions, they could be found in the tiny bric-a-brac shop where Mademoiselle Berthe Weill showed young and undiscovered artists, or in the little gallery on the rue Lafitte run by the ex-clown Clovis Sagot. More often they could be seen in another rue Lafitte establishment, picking their way through the disorderly stacks of canvases in the gallery run by the wily and unctuous Ambroise Vollard. Vollard, it was rumored, kept his better things hidden away in back rooms, waiting for prices to rise--among them a superb cache of C�zanne paintings he had been shrewd enough to acquire before the artist died. If one found a painting and took it to him to ask the price, the dealer was apt to put on a look of surprise, then baldly state that he had sold that picture just last month but had been unable to find it--meanwhile hurrying the canvas out of sight.But Vollard sold regularly to the Steins, whom he professed to like. The Steins, he maintained, were less disposed to haggle over the price of a picture than were his richer clients. And the Steins paid promptly. As Vollard once confided to Leo, the rich paid only when they happened to think about it; their thoughts mostly ran to other matters. Among the patrons of the Parisian caf�s, the Steins were considered to be wealthy American eccentrics. Leo, in fact, was referred to as an American Maecenas. But boulevard appraisals carried little weight with Vollard. He made it his business to know the precise financial situations of his customers. He had learned that the Steins' modest but comfortable income from San Francisco properties did not place them in the same category as his millionaire clients, such as the H. O. Have-meyers and Charles Loeser, who also bought C�zannes. But Vollard maintained that he liked dealing with Leo and his sister. They were the only clients, he said, who bought pictures "not because they were rich, but despite the fact that they weren't."Gertrude and Leo Stein were not the only members of the family addicted to modern art. Their elder brother Michael and his wife, Sarah, were avid collectors, too. The Michael Steins maintained an apartment on the nearby rue Madame, having moved there from San Francisco with their young son Allan shortly after Leo and Gertrude had settled in Paris in 1903. Its walls were also studded with modern paintings, most of them handsome early works by Matisse. Michael Stein--a paunchy, dapper man with fastidiously trimmed mustache andbeard--was the conservative, business-minded member of the family. With hard work and the shrewd sale of his father's railroad interests, Michael had turned the family holdings to sufficient account to endow each member with a comfortable income. It was Michael who kept a watchful eye on Gertrude and Leo's joint finances, cautioning them about their overdrawn accounts, advising fiscal responsibility. But it was Michael who advanced the necessary sums when Leo and Gertrude found themselves lacking the funds to buy a particularly tempting pair of Gauguins. His wife, Sarah--Sally to her friends--was a sweet, motherly-looking woman. An aspiring artist, she was one of the first and most dedicated students in the painting classes that Matisse conducted early in his career.Disgruntled conservative artists whose works never entered the Stein collections referred to the family as the "Stein Corporation," as if it were an aesthetic cartel. Among such artists there was speculation as to whether the Steins bought their peculiar paintings because they liked them or whether they liked them because they had bought them. So familiar was the association of the Steins with everything radical in Parisian art that French art critics--horrified by the so-called infantile smears of Matisse's paintings and casting about for explanations-claimed that such work was clearly intended only for gullible and benighted Americans. The French, quite obviously, were not to be taken in by the crude hoaxes hanging on the walls of an upstart American salon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The marvel was that the studio room at 27, rue de Fleurus--large by ordinary domestic standards but small for such a public function--should have held so many paintings, so many people. The Steins had set about collecting so industriously that the three available walls of the studio--the fourth was cut by the double door and oddly shaped windows that let in the northern light--were crammed with pictures hung row above row. In the dim and fluttering gaslight, only the lower ranges of art were clearly visible. Visitors had to shade their eyes from the glare of the low-hanging fixtures in order to pierce the gloom in which many of the pictures hung tantalizingly above.But, even at the lower levels, there was enough to take in. Closely packed along one wall were a row of C�zanne watercolors, their exacting brushstrokes sketching out woodland glades and the rising fronts of austere mountains. Above them the brilliant fireworks of Matisse's Fauve pictures jostled Picasso's sober green-and-tan Spanish landscapes --pictures that carried in them the first hints of Cubist rectitude. A huge Picasso of a nude youth leading a horse, a painting from the artist's Rose Period, crowned the space above a cumbersome Henri IVbuffet. Across the room the Picasso's scale was more than matched by Matisse's pastorale <i>Joy of Life</i>, a landscape idyll of frenziedly dancing figures and entwined nudes. On another wall a nude by Felix Vallotton --an attempt by a lesser man to recapture the shock of Manet's famous <i>Olympia</i>--sprawled out clinically on a crisp white sheet. Her quixotic expression and relaxed arm seemed to call attention to the small, precious Maurice Denis of a nursing mother and child hanging directly below it.The pictures seemed like a seraglio--viewed in the modern manner. Nudes proliferated everywhere: in the awkward nakedness of C�zanne's <i>Bathers</i>, in the amiable roughhousing of Renoir's plump and gamboling females, in a Bonnard girl lying in suggestive exhaustion on a rumpled bed. There was Picasso's nude nymphet, wise beyond her years, holding a basket of flowers. It was this frankness of subject matter, this unembarrassed display of the Steins' sensual tastes, as much as the audacity of the painting styles that produced the expected shock for visitors who had come to be astounded.The room was a jumble of furniture as well, crowding guests into a sense of intimacy. A long, sturdy Florentine table surrounded by Renaissance chairs was drawn close to the cast-iron stove at the back of the room. There were sideboards and buffets and bulky chests and little tables settled along walls and in corners. Each supported its full weight of accumulated objects: bronze Buddhas and fragments of bas-reliefs, a plaster head by Picasso, a coy modern Venus by Elie Nadelman, Matisse's early bronze <i>The Slave</i>. There were cheap porcelain figurines, costly Renaissance plates, tiny alabaster urns with alabaster doves balancing at the rims--objects Gertrude bought when she visited curio shops. Leaning against the walls were large portfolios of Japanese prints and Picasso drawings.In time, the art burst out of the confines of this public room and was given refuge in the adjacent pavilion. There, Picasso and Matisse drawings were tacked to the double doors that led to the cramped dining room. In the dining room itself there were no pictures. The walls were lined with Gertrude and Leo's collection of books: college texts, books on psychology, philosophy, and history (Leo's amorphous territory); assorted volumes of English and American writers--cheap and expensive editions alike of Shakespeare, Trollope, and the English poets (Gertrude's special interest). But there were other spaces in the pavilion that could accommodate the overflow of their expanding art collection. Paintings that could not sustain their impact amid the exacting standards of the studio were transferred to Leo's small ground-floor study, which came to be known as the <i>salon des refus�s</i>. Or they were lodged in the second-floor bedrooms. In one of these, Gertrude hung on the ceiling above her bed the testimonial of her enduring friendship with Picasso, the painter's little <i>Homage to Gertrude</i>--a picture atonce intimate and extravagant in its pleasures, the canvas crowded with big-breasted angels accompanying a woman modestly bearing a plate of fruit.IIIf there had been such a thing as an international conspiracy to promote modern art in the early years of this century, 27, rue de Fleurus would have been close to the heart of it. "The place was charged with the atmosphere of propaganda," Leo remembered. The Steins, however, did not have sole custody of the modern movement. Many of the guests who crowded their Saturday evenings had come to the new art on their own. But the Steins had so placed themselves at the center of the network of journalists, publicists, advocates, and collectors who were spreading the gospel of modernism that, sooner or later, anyone interested in modern art would find his way to the rue de Fleurus. There he could assure himself of the continuing vitality of Matisse's and Picasso's stylistic ventures, and catch up with the latest cultural gossip.Among the guests at 27, rue de Fleurus, there was an improbable mixture of types and nationalities: impoverished art students and wealthy collectors, ardent Swedish followers of the moderne, gregarious Americans looking for fun, irritating Germans who wanted to be shown things that had been placed out of reach. It did not escape Gertrude's attention that there was an unusually constant flow of Hungarians. She accounted for it as best she could. "It happened," she said, "that some hungarian had once been brought and the word had spread from him throughout all Hungary, any village where there was a young man who had ambitions heard of 27 rue de Fleurus and then he lived but to get there and a great many did get there ... , all sizes and shapes, all degrees of wealth and poverty, some very charming, some simply rough and every now and then a very beautiful young peasant."Inevitably, the tourists came because it was the thing to do when one was in Paris. A few went away converted, spreading the gospel of modernism among the heathen, sending fresh troops for later visits. Others came to scoff at the pictures, barely able to conceal their laughter before the doors closed behind them. Some came purposely to bait the artists.

The volume uses the language of the Other as a vehicle for rethinking aspects of psychological processes, especially within the therapeutic context. As a group, the contributors demonstrate that the language of the Other may be more fitting than the egocentric language frequently employed in psychology. They also embrace the challenge to create new theories and practices that are more ethically attuned to the dynamic realities of psychological functioning. <br><br>The book is organized into three sections. The first deals with foundational philosophical concerns and provides an introduction to the project of "thinking Otherwise." The second section brings these fundamental philosophical concerns to bear on the therapeutic situation, especially in the realm of relational psychoanalysis. The final section of the book addresses concrete psychological situations in which the Other figures prominently and where the power of thinking Otherwise is most visibly demonstrated.<br></p><p>Mark Freeman is Distinguished Professor of Ethics and Society andProfessor of Psychology at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester,Massachusetts.&nbsp; His writings include Rewriting the Self: History,Memory, Narrative (Routledge, 1993); Finding the Muse: ASociopsychological Inquiry into the Conditions of Artistic Creativity(Cambridge, 1994); Hindsight: The Promise and Peril of Looking Backward(Oxford, 2010); The Priority of the Other: Thinking and Living Beyondthe Self (Oxford, 2014); and numerous articles and chapters on issuesranging from memory and identity to the psychology of art and religion.

This beautifully produced volume celebrates the unsurpassed splendor of a fabled region, while also presenting the environmental complexities of managing a vast landscape in which the needs of ranchers, biologists, miners, tourists, and locals seek a finely delineated balance.</p><p>Photographer Laura McPhee follows in the tradition of 19th-century artistic approaches toward the sublime, relying on a large-format view camera to capture images of exquisite color, clarity, and definition. In images spanning all seasons, McPhee depicts the magnificence and history of the Sawtooth Valley in central Idaho. Her subject matter includes the region&#x2019;s spectacular mountain ranges, rivers, and ranchlands; its immense spaces and natural resources; the effects of mining and devastating wildfires; and the human stories of those who live and work there.

A pivotal figure in the postminimalist generation who was also the son of a prominent Surrealist, Matta-Clark was a leader in the downtown artists' community in New York in the 1970s, and is widely seen as a pioneer of what has come to be known as social practice art. He is celebrated for his &#x201c;anarchitectural&#x201d; environments and performances, and the films, photographs, drawings, and sculptural fragments with which his site-specific work was documented. In studies of his career, the artist&#x2019;s provocative and vivid language is referenced constantly. Yet the verbal aspect of his practice has not previously been examined in its own right. Blending close readings of Matta-Clark&#x2019;s visual and verbal creations with reception history and critical biography, this extensively researched study engages with the linguistic and semiotic forms in Matta-Clark&#x2019;s art, forms that activate what he called the &#x201c;poetics of psycho-locus&#x201d; and &#x201c;total (semiotic) system.&#x201d; Examining notes, statements, titles, letters, and interviews in light of what they reveal about his work at large, Frances Richard unearths archival, biographical, and historical information, linking Matta-Clark to Conceptualist peers and Surrealist and Dada forebears. <i>Gordon Matta-Clark: Physical Poetics</i> explores the paradoxical durability of Matta-Clark&#x2019;s language, and its role in an aggressively physical oeuvre whose major works have been destroyed.</p><p>"In Frances Richard's hands, language is more than just a theme. It is a practice, a way of thinking, and it becomes a critical framework that changes the way we see the artist, his work, his language, and the sociohistorical context in which all are embedded."&#x2014;Gwen Allen, Professor of Art History, San Francisco State University<br><br> "Like a well-written novel, what might appear as factual minutia becomes enlivened by Richard into a penetrating character analysis; we become more and more invested in learning about this unusual artist whose career and life were cut short by illness and death. Fortunately, <i>Gordon Matta-Clark: Physical Poetics</i> doesn't stop at mere biography.

Gonz�lez, Professor of Art History and Visual Culture, University of California, Santa Cruz<br><br> "Energetic and well-informed, Richard keeps&nbsp;the quirkiness of her subject in mind as she demonstrates a broad and deep knowledge of, and sympathy for, Gordon Matta-Clark, capturing the range of his interests and engagements."&#x2014;Jack Flam, Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Art and Art History, City University of New York and President, Dedalus Foundation<b>Frances Richard</b> is the author of three books of poetry, coauthor of <i>Odd Lots: Revisiting Gordon Matta-Clark&#x2019;s &#x201c;Fake Estates,&#x201d;</i> and editor of <i>Joan Jonas is on our mind</i> and <i>I Stand in My Place with My Own Day Here: Site-Specific Art at The New School</i>.

He had published a volume of poetry (<i>The Marble Faun</i>), had written a few book reviews, and had contributed sketches to the University of Mississippi student newspaper. He had served a stint in the Royal Canadian Air Corps and while working in a New Haven bookstore had become acquainted with the wife of the writer Sherwood Anderson.</p><p> In his first six months in New Orleans, where the Andersons were living, Faulkner made his initial foray into serious fiction writing. Here in one volume are the pieces he wrote while in the French Quarter. These were published locally in the <i>Times-Picayune</i> and in the <i>Double Dealer</i>.</p><p> The pieces in <i>New Orleans Sketches</i> broadcast seeds that would take root in later works. In their themes and motifs these sketches and stories foreshadow the intense personal vision and style that would characterize Faulkner&#x2019;s mature fiction. As his sketches take on parallels with Christian liturgy and as they portray such characters as an idiot boy similar to Benjy Compson, they reveal evidence of his early literary sophistication.</p><p> In praise of <i>New Orleans Sketches</i>, Alfred Kazin wrote in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> that &#x201c;the interesting thing for us now, who can see in this book the outline of the writer Faulkner was to become, is that before he had published his first novel he had already determined certain main themes in his work.&#x201d;</p><p> In his trailblazing introduction, Carvel Collins often called &#x201c;Faulkner&#x2019;s best-informed critic,&#x201d; illuminates the period when the sketches were written as the time that Faulkner was making the transition from poet to novelist.</p><p> &#x201c;For the reader of Faulkner,&#x201d; Paul Engle wrote in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, &#x201c;the book is indispensable. Its brilliant introduction . . . is full both of helpful information . . . and of fine insights.&#x201d; &#x201c;We gain something more than a glimpse of the mind of a young genius asserting his power against a partially indifferent environment,&#x201d; states the <i>Book Exchange </i>(London). &#x201c;The long introduction . . . must rank as a major literary contribution to our knowledge of an outstanding writer: perhaps the greatest of our times.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Faulkner&#x2019;s early fictional forays that foreshadow a Nobel Laureate in the making<b>William Faulkner</b> (1897-1962) is considered one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century.

On the surface, this book is a profound and intelligent discussion of where mysticism and parapsychological science intersect. But at its core, this is a tender book about living a life of peace and feeling connected to universal love. In the opening chapters, the authors address the illusion that we are separate from other beings--one that has tainted our scientific and spiritual models for decades. From here the authors move into scientific evidence for mind-to-mind and spirit-to-spirit connections and how to experience this "oneness" (or, as the title suggests, how to experience God) through freeing the heart and quieting the mind.<p> Their most groundbreaking chapter is "Why Scientists Pray," in which the authors challenge the stereotype of the cold, unfeeling scientist and show us just how dedicated and spiritual the heart of a scientist can truly be. This is an especially supportive book for contemporary scientists who are trying to break out of the current mold and create a more mystical and intuitive approach to inquiry. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p></p><h2>Understanding Your Users: A Practical Guide to User Requirements Methods, Tools, and Techniques (Interactive Technologies)</h2><p>Today many companies are employing a user-centered design (UCD) process, but for most companies, usability begins and ends with the usability test. Although usability testing is a critical part of an effective user-centered life cycle, it is only one component of the UCD process.

Educated informally in her father's library and in Bloomsbury's London extension of Cambridge, Virginia Woolf came of age in the prewar decades, when progressive political and social movements gave hope that Europe "might really be on the brink of becoming civilized," as Leonard Woolf put it. For pacifist Bloomsbury, heir to Europe's unfinished Enlightenment project of human rights, democratic self-governance, and world peace&#x2015;and, in E. M. Forster's words, "the only genuine <i>movement</i> in English civilization"&#x2015; the 1914 "civil war" exposed barbarities within Europe: belligerent nationalisms, rapacious racialized economic imperialism, oppressive class and sex/gender systems, a tragic and unnecessary war that mobilized sixty-five million and left thirty-seven million casualties. An avant-garde in the twentieth-century struggle against the violence within European civilization, Bloomsbury and Woolf contributed richly to interwar debates on Europe's future at a moment when democracy's triumph over fascism and communism was by no means assured.<br><br>Woolf honed her public voice in dialogue with contemporaries in and beyond Bloomsbury&#x2015; John Maynard Keynes and Roger Fry to Sigmund Freud (published by the Woolfs'Hogarth Press), Bertrand Russell, T.

For Bloomsbury the 1914 "civil war" exposed barbarity <i>within</i> European civilization-belligerent nationalism, racialized economic imperialism, oppressive class and sex/gender systems-the Versailles Peace fostered totalitarianism and led to a second world war. An avant-garde in the struggle against the violence within, Bloomsbury contributed richly to interwar debates as liberal democracy, socialism, fascism, and communism contended over Europe's future.From her first novel, <i>The Voyage Out</i>, to her last, <i>Between the Acts</i>, Woolf honed her public voice alongside Bloomsbury contemporaries John Maynard Keynes, Roger Fry, Sigmund Freud, Bertrand Russell, T.

Instead of emphasizing society and customs, this volume deals with the physical conditions of life. In place of the conventional interest in "founding fathers" and leading families, it is more concerned with street scenes and ordinary people.

In this new volume, 24 chapters written by experts in the field discuss epigenetic effects from many perspectives. There are chapters on the basic molecular mechanisms underpinning epigenetic regulation, discussion of cellular processes that rely on this kind of regulation, and surveys of organisms in which it has been most studied. Thus, there are chapters on histone and DNA methylation, siRNAs and gene silencing; X-chromosome inactivation, dosage compensation and imprinting; and discussion of epigenetics in microbes, plants, insects, and mammals. The last part of the book looks at how epigenetic mechanisms act in cell division and differentiation, and how errors in these pathways contribute to cancer and other human diseases. Also discussed are consequences of epigenetics in attempts to clone animals. This book is a major resource for those working in the field, as well as being a suitable text for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses on gene regulation.</p><p>The historical accounts of the rise of epigenetics as a field of study, combined with the inclusion of cutting-edging epigenetics research in various biological processes and model organisms, provide the reader with a clear sense of what epigenetics research is about, where it came from, where it is now, and where it is headed. It will prove to be the book that everyone with an interest in epigenetics would want to have and read. Cell; As a whole, Epigenetics is an impressive volume. The contributors provide an accurate survey of the field, from where it began, through where it is today, to where it is heading. Their accounts help set the stage for deepening our understanding of epigenetic phenomena and mechanisms. And the volume will undoubtedly prove to be very useful for students and researchers alike. --Science;Overall, Epigenetics is a scholarly work, eminently readable and a welcome resource for anyone looking for an introduction to this new and vibrant field.--BioEssays; Beautifully illustrated, this book is a rich source of information for a diverse pool of readers, ranging from graduate students making their first steps in a new field of knowledge to more experienced scientists whose research has led them to unfamiliar grounds. What makes; Epigenetics; a truly remarkable and, I believe, a long-lasting achievement is the clear and accessible overview of the major concepts and mechanisms that lay in the foundation of contemporary chromatin research. New details of how specific enzymes and proteins shape chromatin structure and composition may emerge, but the general principles that define how chromatin impacts on many cellular processes are likely to hold true; Genetical Research;In addition to the cutting-edge epigenetic research that is highlighted in this book by eminent scientists in the field, the summaries at the beginning of each chapter, and the multiple tables and colourful illustrations used throughout the book will prove useful in guiding the reader through a discussion of complex biological processes. Undoubtedly, some of these illustrations will be widely used by students and teacher of epigenetics. It is evident that the importance of epigenetics has become widely recognized and this book will be an excellent read for beginners as well as experts in this field; --Nature Cell Biology; What is epigenetics? Asking that question will likely return a number of answers that are all some variation of &#39;heredity that is not due to changes in DNA sequence.&#39; In other words, epigenetics is not genetics. That seems a definition as indistinct as U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart&#39;s statement, &#39;I know it when I see it,&#39; about obscenity. The recent volume, Epigenetics, provides well-needed clarity by setting down the fundamental concepts and principles of this emerging science... With the publication of Epigenetics, this fascinating scientific field no longer needs to be defined by what it is not. --The Quarterly Review of Biology</p><h2>Monument Culture: International Perspectives on the Future of Monuments in a Changing World (American Association for State and Local History)</h2><p><br>Monument Culture: International Perspectives on the Future of Monuments in a Changing World brings together a collection of essays from scholars and cultural critics working on the meanings of monuments and memorials in the second decade of the twenty-first century, a time of great social and political change. <br><br>The book presents a broad view of the challenges facing individuals and society in making sense of public monuments with contested meanings. From the United States to Europe to Africa to Australia and New Zealand to South America and beyond, the contributors tackle the ways in which different places approach monuments in a landscape where institutions and ideas are under direct challenge from political and social unrest. It also discusses sharply changed attitudes about the representation of history and memory in the public sphere. <br><br>The goal is to acknowledge shared experiences through a wider perspective; to contribute to the work of the world-wide heritage community; and to document the history and shifting cultural attitudes towards monument culture across the world, encouraging a more informed approach to monuments and their meanings especially for the public and those outside of academia.</p><p>Laura A. Macaluso researches and writes about museums, monuments, and material culture.

She lives in Lynchburg, Virginia.Macaluso&#x2019;s Monument Culture features a wide-ranging, insightful group of essays that span the globe and illuminate one of the most critical issues of our time. From Antarctica to South Korea and beyond, this book is essential reading to understand how communities choose to remember and memorialize the contested past. (David B. Allison, editor of Controversial Monuments and Memorials: A Guide for Community Leaders)<br><br><p>A public historian and scholar of art and culture, Macaluso presents global perspectives on the meaning and use of monuments and memorials and the broader categorization of monument culture and its shifting terrain internationally. The book's 20 essays address monuments in terms of landscape, people, and sense of place; trauma and violence/reconciliation and reparation; migration and identity; the practice of monuments (away from the built environment and toward installations, ephemera, and social media); and controversy and difficult histories. Many contributions, along with the opening and closing essays, overlap in addressing these five themes and thereby demonstrate how contemporary monument culture is concerned universally with constructions of identity, community, and history. Varied in methodology, literary style, and disciplinary approach, the essays bring together scholarship and artistic and social practice from seven continents and a number of academic fields. Offering brief, thoughtful, and enriching case studies that demonstrate the possibilities of an informed understanding of monuments yesterday, today, and tomorrow, Monument Culture will interest students and scholars of history, public history, public art, and engaged social practice as well as those in the cultural heritage sector.<br><br>Summing Up: Recommended. Lower-division undergraduates through faculty and professionals; general readers. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>The authors in Monument Culture do not promise solutions to the conundrums posed by monuments in today&#x2019;s world.

This detailed case study discloses the full scope of that concealed policy, and untangles the complex web of major players who implemented and then covered it up.</p><p>Mark Phythian is Lecturer in Politics in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Wolverhampton, England.A chilling report on how Western vendors, with the covert connivance of their governments, helped oil-rich Iraq to acquire a state-of-the-art arsenal. Focusing on the role played by United Kingdom suppliers in the lucrative arms trade with Baghdad, Phythian (a faculty member at England's Wolverhampton University) first reviews why London and Washington (determined that Iraq should not lose the war it had started with Iran in 1981) allowed the despotic, expansion-minded Hussein regime to procure from domestic sources under their control not only advanced weaponry but also the means to build nuclear bombs. According to his authoritative account, most such business was done by legitimate enterprises tacitly encouraged to evade or ignore official embargoes. Further, because of application ambiguities (e.g., certain agricultural chemicals may be employed in either fertilizers or poison gases), dealers could plausibly deny any illegal intent in their wide-ranging export efforts. With jobs, profits, and the balance of power in a volatile region at stake, moreover, first-world capitals turned a blind eye to contraband traffic and risky transfers of dual-use technologies. The technology and weapons the West had so blithely supplied to Iraq were, of course, used against UN coalition forces during the battle for Kuwait. In the wake of Desert Storm, the UK and US launched investigations that eventually disclosed that the governments of both countries had played a duplicitous game, acting in ways at considerable variance with stated positions. The drawn- out inquiries also revealed that intelligence services routinely recruited the executives of defense contractors (including several the British Crown attempted to prosecute) to furnish information on their sales trips to Iraq. A timely, convincingly documented reminder that, even in democratic societies, actions taken in the name of national security may not be in the national interest. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

At the same time flower paintings which were remarkable for their apparent realism were produced all over Holland and purchased by Dutch families as enduring substitutes for the real thing. This beautiful book reveals the fascinating genesis and growth of a whole genre of paintings that has rarely been studied.<br>Paul Taylor begins by discussing Holland's 'tulipomania' and its effect on the way people thought about floral still lifes. He then considers the religious messages associated with the flower paintings, exploring how religious writers spoke of flowers as moral signposts from God and how some flower paintings were meant to remind viewers of the transience of earthly existence. Flower paintings were not bought only as records of luxury objects or for moral edification, however. They were also enjoyed as works of art, as masterpieces of illusion, composition and colour harmony, so Taylor analyses the art-theoretical writings of the time in order to understand how artists and connoisseurs responded to flower pieces. He concludes by analysing the paintings themselves, tracing the development and refinement of the actual practice of flower painting.</p><p>This scholarly work examines 17th-century Dutch flower painting within the contexts of symbolism, political and economic events, religion, art criticism, and the art market. Detailed discussions use 17th-century sources to explore the significance of these paintings to their cultural contemporaries. Attractive reproductions, most of them in color, serve to illustrate the points that are made in the text. Interested lay readers are likely to enjoy the reproductions and discussions of individual painters. Because much of the book concentrates on fairly narrow interpretive issues, however, it will be of primary interest to scholars and students of the period.

What should our military look like? What lessons have we learned from recent actions in Afghanistan and Iraq? Macgregor has captured the attention of key leaders and inspired a genuine public debate on military reform. With the dangerous world situation of the early 21st century-and possible flashpoints ranging from the Middle East to the Far East-interservice cooperation in assembling small, mobile units and a dramatically simplified command structure is essential. MacGregor's controversial ideas, favored by the current Bush administration, would reduce timelines for deployment, enhance responsiveness to crises, and permit rapid decision-making and planning.The Army is the nation's primary instrument of land warfare, but what capabilities can the Army field today, and what is the Joint Commander likely to need tomorrow? Stuck with a force structure that hasn't changed since Word War II, as well as an outdated command system, today's Army faces potential failure in a modern war. Without a conceptual redefinition of warfare as a joint operation, a new military culture that can execute joint expeditionary warfare will not emerge. New technology both compels and enables evolution of the armed forces' organization. MacGregor's visionary plan to integrate ground maneuver forces with powerful strike assets is the foundation for a true revolution in military affairs, and has sparked heated debates in policy and military circles.</p></p><p><p>MacGregor argues for a tight integration between air and ground forces to change the way that our armed forces organize their capacity to fight.</p><p>DOUGLAS A.

Now, for the first time, the full lyricism, humor, and pathos of his greatest plays are available to an English-speaking audience. Marina Brodskaya's new translations of <i>Ivanov</i>, <i>The Seagull</i>, <i>Uncle Vanya</i>, <i>Three Sisters</i>, and <i>The Cherry Orchard</i> not only surpass in accuracy all previous translations, but also provide the first complete English text of the plays, restoring passages entirely omitted by her predecessors. This much-needed volume renders Chekhov in language that will move readers and theater audiences alike, making accessible his wordplay, unstated implications, and innovations. His characters' vulnerabilities, needs, and neuroses&#x2015;their humanity&#x2015;emerge through their genuine, self-absorbed conversations. The plays come to life as never before and will surprise readers with their vivacity, originality, and relevance.</p><p>Marina Brodskaya is a translator, interpreter, and teacher who was born and raised in Leningrad/St. Petersburg. She now lives in Northern California."[A]nyone who has taught Chekhov's plays or produced them theatrically, certainly anyone with a knowledge of the original texts, must have been frustrated by the marked defects of previous translations. Brodskaya's translation allows us to discover Chekhovian precision and the impact of his strategic word-choices, together with the light these shine on the fabric of modern drama and communication. It is deeply attuned to the spirit of Chekhov's language and his compassionate observation of humans caught in the net of their own habits and blind spots, striving to stop, cause, or foresee the huge change that has already engulfed them." (Monika Greenleaf <i>from her <i>Notes on the Translation</i></i>)<br><br>"Tender, lucent translation that makes Chekhov's characters leap off the page." (Larry Moss)<br><br>"Chekhov's desperate, comedic greatness comes through in these versions as never before&#x2015;and precisely those two qualities are required, for Chekhov is neither infernal tragedy nor trivial farce but a special sort of purgatorial comedy. I sensed this aura for the first time in Brodskaya's translations, and shivered while laughing. This is a contemporary American-English variant of world-famous plays cast at perfect pitch, by a person who <i>sees</i> (as well as hears) words." (Caryl Emerson)<br><br>"With Chekhov, there are infinite possibilities in every thought, every interaction. All an actor asks for in a translation is that these possibilities be left open as they are so beautifully here." (Peter Sarsgaard <i>actor</i>)<br><br>"Brodskaya's translation reads easily and naturally... If you haven't read [Chekhov], read him. If you have, it's always a good time to read him again." (Bob Blaisdell <i><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></i>)<br><br>"In these superlative translations, Marina Brodskaya succeeds in letting Chekhov speak for himself. Her sensitivity to Chekhov's concise and delicate language allows the beauty of his writing to shine through in a way which is wonderfully redolent of the original Russian."

Author Shoji Sadao, who was a friend and business partner to both, chronicles the deep and abiding respect, affection, and support they had for one other. Fuller's development of his dymaxion Map, Geodesic geometry, and the dymaxion Car are discussed in detail as are Noguchi's multi-faceted career as sculptor, landscape architect, industrial designer, and dance set designer, an artist without borders who challenged the artificial opposition between the fine and applied arts. Sadao's role as partner to both offered him privileged access to details unavailable to others.<br>Influences on their work are noted, significant projects are described and illustrated, and pertinent quotes are cited, all contributing to a warm and intimate illustrated narrative that documents the exceptional relationship between these two great twentieth-century artists.</p><p>Shoji Sadao is an architect who collaborated with both R.

Now, in <em>Mr. Bloomfield's Orchard</em>, Nicholas Money introduces readers to a dazzling array of fungi, from brewer's yeast and <em>Penicillium</em> to the highly lethal death cap. <br> This is an entertaining book that also provides a solid introduction to the biology of fungi as well as much insight into how scientists study fungi in the lab and in the field. Readers will be intrigued by the many exotic fungi discussed. One fungus in Oregon, for instance, covers 2,000 acres and is now considered the world's largest organism. We learn of <em>Madurella</em>, which can erode bones until they look moth-eaten; <em>Cordyceps</em>, which wracks insects with convulsions, kills them, then sends a stalk out of the insect's head to release more infectious spores; and <em>Claviceps</em>, the poisonous ergot fungus, which causes hallucinations (the women charged with "demonic possession" in Salem in 1691 may have been victims of ergot consumption). Money also showcases the lives of famed mycologists--including Reginald Buller who wore horse blinders as he walked to work, the better to study luminescent fungi in his dark lab, and Charles Tulasne, the Audubon of fungi, whose illustrations of specimens border on art. And he recounts his own childhood introduction to fungi in Mr. Bloomfield's orchard, where trees and fruit were devoured by a rogue's gallery of bitter rot, canker, rust, powdery mildew, rubbery wood, and scab.<br> Told with a refreshing sense of humor, <em>Mr. Bloomfield's Orchard</em> will fascinate anyone interested in the natural world.</p><p><br><strong>Nicholas P.

Money is an English-born mycologist who has spent his life uncovering the secrets and lore of fungi, including varieties that thrive in solid granite, feed on human flesh, assist in crime-scene investigations, and, as in the case of a particular armillaria covering twenty-two hundred acres in Oregon, grow to become the largest organisms on earth."--<em>The New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"A fascinating closeup of some of the author's favorite fungi, including mushrooms, molds, rusts, and aquatic species."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"A forest carpeted with mushrooms; dandruff; athlete's foot; and killer diseases that attack the lungs and nervous system all come under Money's expert scrutiny as he reveals the realm of fungi in all its amazing diversity. Assuredly fascinating and highly entertaining, Money's chronicle boasts an inimitable style that mixes up factbased information and creative analogies. Stories of scientists such as A. H. R. Bullet, who recorded his discoveries in countless volumes, together with Money's curious observations--such as his attentive look at black mold growing on window frames and contemplation of the realities of flesh-penetrating organisms that do great bodily harm--keep things lively....

Or is he? Someone died in the explosion orchestrated by his business rivals, but even as his funeral is scheduled, his mourning employees are receiving bewildering messages from their boss. And the world around them is warping and regressing in ways which suggest that their own time is running out. If it hasn&#39;t already.</p><p>Nobody but Philip K. Dick could so successfully combine SF comedy with the unease of reality gone wrong, shifting underfoot like quicksand. Besides grisly ideas like funeral parlors where you swap gossip for the advice of the frozen dead, <i>Ubik</i> (1969) offers such deadpan farce as a moneyless character's attack on the robot apartment door that demands a five-cent toll:<p> </p><blockquote>"I'll sue you," the door said as the first screw fell out.<p> Joe Chip said, "I've never been sued by a door. But I guess I can live through it."</p></blockquote><p> Chip works for Glen Runciter's anti-psi security agency, which hires out its talents to block telepathic snooping and paranormal dirty tricks. When its special team tackles a big job on the Moon, something goes terribly wrong. Runciter is killed, it seems--but messages from him now appear on toilet walls, traffic tickets, or product labels. Meanwhile, fragments of reality are timeslipping into past versions: Joe Chip's beloved stereo system reverts to a hand-cranked 78 player with bamboo needles. Why does Runciter's face appear on U.S. coins? Why the repeated ads for a hard-to-find universal panacea called Ubik ("safe when taken as directed")?</p><p> The true, chilling state of affairs slowly becomes clear, though the villain isn't who Joe Chip thinks. And this is Dick country, where final truths are never quite final and--with the help of Ubik--the reality/illusion balance can still be tilted the other way. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><p> From the stuff of space opera, Dick spins a deeply unsettling existential horror story, a nightmare you ll never be sure you ve woken up from. Lev Grossman, <i>Time</i> <br>Glen Runciter runs a lucrative business deploying his teams of anti-psychics to corporate clients who want privacy and security from psychic spies. But when he and his top team are ambushed by a rival, he is gravely injured and placed in half-life, a dreamlike state of suspended animation. Soon, though, the surviving members of the team begin experiencing some strange phenomena, such as Runciter s face appearing on coins and the world seeming to move backward in time. As consumables deteriorate and technology gets ever more primitive, the group needs to find out what is causing the shifts and what a mysterious product called Ubik has to do with it all. <br> More brilliant than similar experiments conducted by Pynchon or DeLillo.

For over 30 years, he has explored his desire to imagine new worlds, to tell stories and to engage with others. This interest is rooted in his sense of play and possibility--an endless curiosity that continually drives him to ask, "What if?" What if you could step inside a crystal goblet? What if your environment transformed with every step? What if a restaurant could vanish at a moment's notice? What if your ultimate escapist fantasy was real? <i>What If...?</i> presents a wide array of Rockwell's brilliant explorations of the rich intersection between architecture and theater. Through immersive imagery and behind-the-scenes details, Rockwell introduces readers to 35 projects, from initial driving idea through physical realization. Works include the famed Nobu Fifty Seven and the newcomer TAO Downtown in New York, the W Paris Op�ra, the West Lobby at The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas and the newly opened TED Theater in Vancouver; set designs for the Academy Awards, <i>Kinky Boots</i> and <i>Hairspray</i>; the Hall of Fragments at the 2008 Venice Architecture Biennale and Jamie Oliver's traveling teaching kitchen, the Food Revolution truck. Engaging texts by Tony Award-winning playwright and screenplay writer John Guare, Tony Award-winning director and producer Jack O'Brien and Pulitzer Prize-winning critic Justin Davidson--written specially for this publication--and a conversation between Rockwell and acclaimed architect Elizabeth Diller round out this spectacular, celebratory volume.<br><b>David Rockwell</b> (born 1956) is an American architect and designer.

The Architecture and Design of David Rockwell succeeds at providing both a compelling overview and detailed insight into Rockwell&#x2019;s career&#x2015;and the impetus for it: a creativity sparked by curiosity and a limitless sense of possibility. (Mario R Mercado <i>travelandleisure.com</i>)<br><br>David Rockwell revels in the emotional side of architecture, in the idea that buildings and parks, restaurants and hotels, museums and theatres, exist to stimulate our imaginations and, in the end, to make us happy. In What If...?:The Architecture and Design of David Rockwell (Metropolis), he shows us how architecture-whether applied to a JetBlue terminal or a Nobu-is not so different from a stage set: it's the special effects that make it work. Rockwell-whose firm is celebrating its 30th anniversary-is so good that he makes you wonder why everyone doesn't admit that the secret ingredient of design is fantasy.

This season's includes those for both the design-and fashion-obsessed: a look at the work of David Rockwell (The Editors <i>Town &amp; Country</i>)<br><br>Whether David Rockwell is designing Broadway sets (most recently Kinky Boots, for which he got a Tony nomination), restaurants (Nobu) or entire buildings (New York's forthcoming Culture Shed), he's telling a story, one that begins with the same question: What if? It's his "once upon a time," a way of setting up an imagined universe. It's also the title of his new book, which comes out in November from Metropolis, with contributions from fellow architect Elizabeth Diller, critic Justin Davidson, playwright John Guare and director Jack O'Brien. (Julian Sancton <i>Departures</i>)<br><br>WHAT IF...?: THE ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN OF DAVID ROCKWELL playfully reveals his outside-the-box thought process. The book is structured as a series of questions: "Where would Marie Antoinette sleep in 21st-century Paris?" (The W Paris Opera hotel.) "What if the bellhop was a robot?" (It is at New York's Yotel.) Rockwell's ingenious designs provide the responses. (Peter Terzian <i>Elle Decor</i>)<br><br>A provocative title like What If...? (Metropolis Books, $45) is a lot for a book to live up to. Fortunately, the work featured in architect David Rockwell&#x2019;s new monograph more than delivers. Each chapter surprises with a spectacular range of projects, from restaurants and hotels to stage sets and playgrounds.

Barbara Alice Mann draws upon worthy sources, be they early or modern, oral or written, to present a Native American point of view that insists upon accuracy, not only in raw reporting, but also in analysis. <i>Iroquoian Women</i> is the first book-length study to regard Iroquoian women as central and indispensable to Iroquoian studies.</p><p>The Author: Barbara Alice Mann, Ph.D., is a noted author and speaker on Iroquoian history and culture. Affiliated with the University of Toledo (Ohio), she co-authored <i>Debating Democracy</i> (1998) with Bruce Johansen and Donald Grinde, Jr., co-edited the <i>Encyclopedia of the Iroquois</i> (2000), and has authored major articles on various aspects of the Iroquois League and its culture. She currently teaches, writes, and works in Toledo.�Barbara Alice Mann has written a superb book, eminently reasonable in its arguments and impeccably documented, while both eloquent and compelling in presentation. &#x2018;Iroquoian Women&#x2019; is an essential corrective to the apparently endless gush of misinformation about the Six Nations issuing from the ranks of &#x2018;trolls&#x2019; who infest the mainstream academic enterprise known as Iroquoian studies. So, too, is it a much-needed and powerful rejoinder to the many marxists, feminists, and other self-styled progressives who have increasingly appropriated and distorted Haudenosaunee tradition for their own polemical purposes. This is truly must reading from one of the best and brightest scholars that Native North America has yet produced.� (Ward Churchill, Professor of Ethnic Studies, University of Colorado at Boulder; Author of &#x2018;A Little Matter of Genocide&#x2019; and numerous other works)<br> �Barbara Alice Mann&#x2019;s work has opened my eyes to the extent of influence that women possessed in Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) society. It is small wonder that some of the &#x2018;Founding Mothers&#x2019; of feminism in the United States (including Elizabeth Cady Stanton) drew inspiration from the Haudenosaunee way of life. With the skills, talents, and memory of a culture bearer and a historian, Barbara Alice Mann provides us with a landmark study of a political and social structure in which women chose the leaders (male and female), tended the hearth, passed on knowledge to children, and decided whether men could take their nations to war. Mann weaves an elegant account of a long-ignored and often misunderstood subject.� (Bruce Johansen, Robert T.

Its argument, anticipated in the author's previous book, <i>The Invention of Culture</i>, is at once symbolic, philosophical, and evolutionary: meaning is a form of perception to which human beings are physically and mentally adapted. Using examples from his many years of research among the Daribi people of New Guinea as well as from Western culture, Wagner approaches the question of the creation of meaning by examining the nonreferential qualities of symbols&#x2014;such as their aesthetic and formal properties&#x2014;that enable symbols to stand for themselves.</p></p><p><b>Roy Wagner</b> is professor of anthropology at the University of Virginia.</p><h2>Contiguity Theory (Linguistic Inquiry Monographs)</h2><p><p><b>An argument that the word order of a given language is largely predictable from independently observable facts about its phonology and morphology.</b></p><p>Languages differ in the types of overt movement they display. For example, some languages (including English) require subjects to move to a preverbal position, while others (including Italian) allow subjects to remain postverbal. In its current form, Minimalism offers no real answer to the question of why these different types of movements are distributed among languages as they are. In <i>Contiguity Theory</i>, Norvin Richards argues that there are universal conditions on morphology and phonology, particularly in how the prosodic structures of language can be built, and that these universal structures interact with language-specific properties of phonology and morphology. He argues that the grammar begins the construction of phonological structure earlier in the derivation than previously thought, and that the distribution of overt movement operations is largely determined by the grammar's efforts to construct this structure. Rather than appealing to diacritic features, the explanations will generally be rooted in observable phenomena. </p><p>Richards posits a different kind of relation between syntax and morphology than is usually found in Minimalism. According to his Contiguity Theory, if we know, for example, what inflectional morphology is attached to the verb in a given language, and what the rules are for where stress is placed in the verb, then we will know where the verb goes in the sentence. Ultimately, the goal is to construct a theory in which a complete description of the phonology and morphology of a given language is also a description of its syntax.</p></p><p>Norvin Richards is Professor of Linguistics at MIT and the author of <i>Uttering Trees </i>(MIT Press).<p>This impressive study, combining original ideas, theoretical acumen, and rich and often novel empirical data, offers explanations for many open and fundamental problems about the structure of linguistic expressions, at the same time posing a fascinating challenge to some standard assumptions about the general architecture of language.&nbsp;It is a major contribution, sure to be influential.</p>&#x2015;<b>Noam Chomsky</b><br><br><p>A bold attempt to derive classic syntactic movements from principles that require access to prosodic structure established early in the syntax.</p>&#x2015;<b>Elisabeth Selkirk</b>, Professor of Linguistics Emerita, University of Massachusetts, Amherst</p><h2>The Archaeology of Class in Urban America (Cambridge Studies in Archaeology)</h2><p>This book explores the material dimensions of class formation in eighteenth-century Newport, Rhode Island, and nineteenth-century Lowell, Massachusetts.

Good Magic Open your life to a whole new world of wonderful possibilities.</p><p><p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>Preparing for Magic</b> </p><p> Open the door: There is magic under the teapot, in your shoestring...and in the wind outside, chanting to you. </p><p> <b>Magic Requires</b> </p><p> TIME </p><p> You might feel you simply cannot fit another project into your day. You might think that magic is for gypsies or witches who were born that way anyhow, or that you need to be initiated by some powerful personage -- and where are you going to find one, between stretch-aerobic classes, office hours and baby teething problems? </p><p> You have picked up this book. Whether you know it or not, magic has already entered your life. Experience magic, even for just a moment, and you will not be the same again. You will see ordinary objects shine like stars -- teacups and saucers becoming holy with life; then you will know that whatever you are spending your time on -- success, relationship, career, family, money -- is only important when it carries inside it that magical quality. </p><p> All you need to do at the beginning is to follow the pull of magic. Give yourself a few minutes -- maybe before going to sleep, when your children are in bed and you are finished for the day. You don't need to be made-up and dressed -- take your most pressing problem and do a little magic for it. See what happens. It will be fun, relaxing and entertaining; something you can do totally alone, something that involves you in an activity that is different, and a pleasure. </p><p> You can begin without complications, using a flower or a concoction of herbs or a single candle. The magic circle and the symbols of the elements (see end of this section) are useful, but not a must. In fact nothing in this course of magic is a must, except your willingness and concentration. At first you may not find an extraordinary result from your magic, but you will begin to <i>feel</i> what it is to <i>do</i> magic. This feeling will stay with you during the rest of the day. You might not notice it, but it will be there, slowly changing and deepening the way you perceive reality. </p><p> Maybe one day you will notice that without any special purpose in mind you have bought a bunch of red roses to adorn your bedroom -- that same evening you spend a very intense, passionate time with the man or woman in your life. Or you suddenly notice the rhymes of a song going round in your head; you listen to the words and you realize, for example, that there are words in the song that make you aware of something you have been wanting for a long time without being conscious of it. Or you could find yourself replacing the old doormat with a new one -- only to greet, later, a long lost friend showing up at your doorstep. </p><p> You begin seeing connections, links between experiences which evade your normal casual way of seeing life. You realize more and more the magic connection. You are not doing anything different; you still eat at eight and take the bus to work -- but slowly everything finds a new meaning. </p><p> Magic rituals and incantations are really only ways of repeating under "laboratory conditions" what is happening in life all the time anyway. Doing them opens your eyes to what you are creating for yourself outside your magic laboratory, in real life, as well as showing you ways in which you can change your life. As you progress in your relationship with magic you see how all of your life's elements are just like pieces of a puzzle which can be moved around by magic, until you form the intended picture -- your real self. </p><p> Then it is not at all a matter of <i>finding time.</i> As you stop running around trying to fulfill ever-growing expectations, outside factors no longer control you, and your time becomes <i>your</i> dimension -- a magic gift of existence for you to express all that you need to express and create all that you want to create within your own life. </p><p> INTENSITY AND CONCENTRATION </p><p> Now you want to proceed with exploring the ins and outs of the magic world, but before looking at the moon and gathering herbs, it is necessary to consider just exactly what you have to <i>be</i> in order to <i>do</i> magic. What do you need to pull out of your own hat, what qualities, what personal attributes? It is not a matter of shining up your past boy-scout memories, or your best achievements as corporate manager. What you need for magic is not so much a quality, as an intention. Everybody is fit for magic, if only they want to be. </p><p> In fact <i>will</i> is the first requisite of magic. You need to focus on the matter at hand, gather as much emotional steam as you can master and will the thing to happen. Second, and equally important, is your unwavering belief that what you do is going to succeed. This is not so much a positive action, something you actively do by repeating to yourself, "this is going to work, this is going to work," but more a peaceful awareness of <i>lack of doubt.</i> It is not easy to be one hundred percent focused and perfectly calm. It is likely that in your normal day a stressful combination of work and/or family will take you as far from calm and concentration as you can be. </p><p> Learning to do magic is like learning to swim -- you learn to do it by doing it. Take a little time out each week from your normal occupations and dedicate it to exploring magic; you will find it becomes easier and easier to concentrate totally on the subject you wish to achieve. This ability and the resulting peacefulness will then spill back out into your normal day. Soon you will be able to see your daily activities as acts of magic where life is no longer controlling you, but you are creating it. </p><p> THE FOUR POWERS OF THE MAGUS </p><p> Knowledge, courage, will and silence: traditionally called the four powers of the magus, these qualities are what you need to aid your ability to focus and to concentrate. </p><p> Here are some details: </p><p> Knowledge This is the voice of your inner wisdom, the part in you which <i>knows.</i> It is not knowledge in the way you learn at school; it is a knowledge which cannot be acquired for it is to be lived or experienced. </p><p> Courage When your own, inner truth challenges ideas and preconceptions you have lived with for a long time, you will need courage to follow it. </p><p> Will This is what keeps you on the path, fending off the thousand and one distractions that can take you away from it. </p><p> Silence This is the ability to shut off the noise of the mind; all the constant thoughts and worries which go around and around in your head. Without this ability, you cannot hear your inner voice. </p><p> Nourish these qualities -- remember them. You don't need a special setting and a special time to do that. You might be sitting in your office or at the counter of a local store or waiting for the subway...just remember: "Am I listening to myself?" </p><p> Remembering the four powers can bring about deep changes in your life. It is in fact the first part of your magic training, and a very important part. Be practical though; don't expect too much too soon. For example, you might be on a train going to the movies and you remember the four powers. Perhaps you realize that this is not what you really want to do. It is easy to get off the train and go home -- in this case you are entirely master of your activities. However, if you are working and your inner voice tells you that this is not the right job for you, it might be a little impractical to get up and leave your job! </p><p> Find alternative ways of being, retrain yourself, and explore new possibilities, for magic is about being intelligent, courageous and present. It is an ever-growing process. By remembering the four powers of the magus often, you will enter this process, and while you see your ability to focus and to concentrate grow every day, your life will be changing from mundane to magical. </p><p> Text Copyright � 1988 by Marina Medici</p></p><h2>A Child&#39;s Portrait of Shakespeare (Shakespeare Can Be Fun series)</h2><p><p> "Who is William Shakespeare?" For more than 20 years, Lois Burdett has asked that question of her elementary school students in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, leading them on a voyage of discovery that brings the Bard to life for boys and girls ages seven and up. </p><p> <i>A Child's Portrait of Shakespeare</i>, written in rhyming couplets is suitable for staging as class plays as well as reading aloud. </p></p><p><p><b> Shakespeare Can Be Fun! </b></p><p> Most students will be exposed to the works of Shakespeare, typically in high school. The language and content of the plays is seen as too difficult for younger children but primary children are underestimated as to what they can accomplish given the challenge. The study of Shakespeare has become an integral part of my grade two program at Hamlet School, in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. </p><p> When I first moved to Stratford, I had no intention of teaching Shakespeare to 7 and 8 year olds. Stratford is a beautiful city noted for its Shakespearean theatre and I was interested that the schools were all named after Shakespearean characters. I asked my class, "Who is William Shakespeare?" and "Why is our school called Hamlet?" Their answers were surprising. One thought he was a famous boxer. Another believed he was the President of Canada. A third student responded, "I don't know who William Shakespeare is. I don't know any of the big kids." It was the children's enthusiasm and excitement on making the connection between an historical figure and the name of their school, which led me to continue. Thirty years later I can't imagine teaching anywhere in the world and not introducing Shakespeare. The study provided tremendous growth, particularly in the area of language and communication and evolved into a learning experience of a lifetime. I have endeavored in my books and workshops for teachers to share the excitement of exploring with children, the timeless emotions and ideas of Shakespeare. </p><p> The comments of two of my children, written at various times in their daily journals show the lasting impression Shakespeare has had on them. </p><p> "Shakespeare is like a big piece of chocolate cake. Once you've started you wish you could go on and on forever, in a non-stopping dream." (Anika, age 7) </p><p> "William's incredible words are like a velvet silk coat that rap around his pure thoughts. His pen writes on like all colors of the wind." (Sean, age 7) </p><p> <b>Lois Burdett</b>'s success in introducing Shakespeare to children is reflected in her growing international reputation. Her books and workshops for teachers have captured the attention and imagination of parents, educators, and lovers of Shakespeare around the world, including the American National Council of Teachers of English and the International Reading Association. Among other commendations, Lois Burdett has received <i>Encyclopedia Britannica's National Award for Early Childhood Education</i>, Canada's <i>Meritorious Service Medal</i>, the Canadian Teachers' Federation's <i>Hilroy Fellowship</i>, and two writers' awards. Burdett's many speaking engagements have included the International Reading Association and the National Council of Teachers of English. Her books, magazine articles, presentations and media interviews are testimony to her strong influence in the education community, where she has also been instrumental in helping teachers to incorporate Shakespeare into early grade curricula. </p></p><h2>The Way I See It, Collector&#39;s Edition: A Personal Look at Autism and Asperger&#39;s</h2><p>In the revised and expanded version of this innovative book, Dr. Temple Grandin gets down to the REAL issues of autism, the ones parents, teachers, and individuals on the spectrum face every day.

Chapters open with a scenario involving real-life students to connect abstract chemical concepts to students' lives. Math is introduced on a need-to-know basis. This conceptual approach first teaches the chemistry and then shows students how to use the math with the chemistry. We recognize how important it is for students to apply chemistry to their world and have added or expanded applications - especially medical- and environment-related applications - throughout the text, marginal notes, worked examples, and end-of-chapter problems.<br>�Consider This features offer conceptual-in-nature questions at the end of worked examples. These questions prompt students to extend their understanding beyond the focus of the worked examples.&nbsp;�Key Concepts replace end-of-chapter summaries. Presented in outline form, they guide student discovery of the most important ideas discussed in each chapter.�Concept Review multiple-choice questions have been added to end-of-chapter questions and problems. Because most students in an introductory chemistry course will take multiple-choice exams, these questions provide them with an outstanding practice opportunity. The conceptual nature of these questions helps students develop deeper understanding and critical thinking skills. After each question, a follow-up question provides additional practice with the analysis of multiple-choice responses.�Four new elements have been named in the Revised Periodic Table: nihonium (Nh, element 113), moscovium (Mc, 115), tennessine (Ts, 117), and oganesson (Og, 118).�The Art Program is considered the best in the market. To help students connect verbal descriptions to molecular-level representations, the program uses symbols and zoomed-in art to show critical phenomena at a molecular level.&nbsp;�The problem-solving approach is supported by worked Example Boxes. Problem solving in chemistry is much more than algorithmic number crunching. It involves applying principles to solve problems. Conceptual problems require students to apply their understanding of concepts instead of just an algorithm. This text emphasizes underlying concepts when discussing numerical problems within in-chapter worked examples as well as end-of-chapter problems.<br>The best approach to incorporating math involves development of associated math on an as-needed basis, with an emphasis on concepts that the problems are trying to illustrate. This text integrates need-to-know mathematical ideas that are important to chemists into conceptual discussions.&nbsp;�Math Toolboxes have been reworked and expanded, and now include accompanying end-of-chapter problems.&nbsp;�Toolbox Icons in the text margins point students to the appropriate review material.&nbsp;�The math reviews provided in the end-of-chapter Math Toolboxes are referenced within appropriate sections of the text.<br>New or enhanced electronic methods to access the material include the ReadAnywhere app that allows students to access their ebook on mobile devices. Once chapters are downloaded, students can use the same tools available in the ebook, and notes and highlights will sync across platforms. The LearnSmart adaptive diagnostic learning system and Heat Maps constantly assess data to determine students' knowledge of the material, time spent answering questions, and percentage of correct answers. These features enable students to develop a strategically timed personal learning path adapted to what they have actively learned and retained. LearnSmart lets the instructor see exactly what students have accomplished and includes a built-in assessment tool for graded assignments.</p><p>Pamela Marks received her B.A. in chemistry from St. Olaf College and her M.A. in inorganic chemistry at the University of Arizona.

He fearlessly engaged it on the level of ideas while remaining alien to its means and ends, gifted with an incurable longing for transcendence." Witness to two world wars, Berdyaev observed the destruction of established cultures in the traumatic birth of new systems. Arrested on political suspicion-by Czarist and then by Bolshevik police&#x2015;he died in exile in France in 1948, carrying forth his intellectual work until the end.</p><p>Berdyaev considered the philosophy of history as a field that laid the foundations of the Russian national consciousness. Its disputes were centered on distinctions between Slavophiles and Westerners, East and West. <em>The Meaning of History </em>was an early effort, following World War I, that attempted to revive this perspective. With the removal of Communism as a ruling system in Russia, that nation returned to an elaboration of a religious philosophy of history as the specific mission of Russian thought. This volume thus has contemporary significance. Its sense of the apocalypse, which distinguishes Russian from Western thought, gives the book its specifically religious character.</p><p>In order to grasp and oppose the complex phenomenon of social and cultural disintegration, Berdyaev shows that human beings must rely upon some internal dialectic. After the debacle of the war, the moment arrived to integrate Russian historical experiences into those of a Europe, which, although torn by schism, still claimed to be the descendant of Christendom. The book is remarkable for its powerful stylistic grace, and astonishingly contemporary feeling.</p></p><p><p> <em>Nikolai Berdyaev</em> had a cultural rather than political abhorrence of the Bolshevik regime, and in 1922, he was expelled from Russia for what was considered his religious mysticism. Among his many works are <i>The Russian Idea</i> and <i>Origin of Russian Communism</i>. <i>Maria Nemcova Banerjee</i> is professor of Russian at Smith College.

Boyer brings together elements and concepts from geography, critical theory, architecture, literature, and painting in a synthetic and readable work that is broad in its reach and original in its insights. What finally emerges is a sense of the city reinvigorated with richness and potential.</p><p><i>The City of Collective Memory</i> describes a series of different visual and mental models by which the urban environment has been recognized, depicted, and planned. Boyer identifies three major "maps": one common to the traditional city&#x2015;the city as a work of art; one characteristic of the modern city&#x2015;the city as panorama; and one appropriate to the contemporary city&#x2015;the city as spectacle. It is a richly illustrated and documented study that pays considerable attention to the normally hidden and unspoken codes that regulate the order imposed on and derived from the city. A wide range of secondary historical literature and theoretical work is considered, with evident debts to structuralist analysis of urban form represented by Aldo Rossi, as well to much post-structuralist criticism from Walter Benjamin to the present.</p></p><p>The City Of Collective Memory is a richly illustrated and documented study that pays considerable attention to the normally hidden and unspoken codes that regulate the order imposed on and derived from the city.M.

(Ellen Handler Spitz, author of <i>The Brightening Glance: Imagination and Childhood</i>)<br><br><i>The Wind in the Willows</i> is one of the few books that inspires unconditional reverence, and it has long deserved a guide as sensitive, deft, insightful, and generous as Seth Lerer. Here, Toad, Rat, Mole, and other characters come alive for both adult and inner child. A splendid achievement. (Maria Tatar, Harvard University)<br><br>You might think it a bit extreme to painstakingly annotate a children's book, but, oh, what a children's book. And oh, what an annotation...[This] is an exquisite examination of the nuances, allusions, Britishisms and context of Kenneth Grahame's wonderful 1908 novel...This big, lovely book is illustrated by some of the most famous Grahame illustrators--Nancy Barnhart, Arthur Rackham, Wyndham Payne and, of course, Ernest H. Shepherd, who brought to life the brash, cigar-smoking, swaggering Mr. Toad. This book is a labor of great scholarship, but it is also, clearly, a labor of love. (Laurie Hertzel <i>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</i> 2009-05-15)<br><br>A handsome edition of Grahame's great classic...One of the delights of this edition is the collection of beautiful illustrations from each edition, from Nancy Barnhart's wonderful 1922 version to Arthur Rackham's in 1940, as well as Paul Bransom's deliciously weird 1913 images for Scribner's. (Lawrence Osborne <i>Forbes</i> 2009-05-07)<br><br>Lerer's book perform[s] magic. [It] demonstrates how much of a writer's life can wind up distilled in a stack of paper--in this case, how Kenneth Grahame's daydreams, fears, heartbreak, upbringing, era and locale all sneaked into a fanciful children's book about talking animals. In what other book can you find slapstick auto theft, a dirge for lost arcadia and a numinous encounter with that pagan refugee and mascot of the Edwardian neo-romantics, the great god Pan?...Lerer's preface is a thoughtful and elegant survey of the biographical and literary context for this beloved book. (Michael Sims <i>Washington Post Book World</i> 2009-06-14)<br><br>[An] exquisite new annotated edition of Kenneth Grahame's masterpiece...It takes us into a pre-modern world of lyrical beauty, with animals that behave like humans, landscapes that are painted for us rather than described, and language more literary than spoken...Rereading this volume, which Harvard University Press has given all the high production values it deserves, led me to understand more fully the soporific effects of <i>The Wind in the Willows</i> on children. Under the spell of an artist who animates his fictional world with something akin to solar energy ("Suddenly the sun was with them again, and grey was gold and colour was born and sprang out of the earth once more"), readers enter dreaded conflict zones but always return to that consummate comfort zone known as Home...By turns ecstatic and elegiac, and always without pathos, sentiment or pyrotechnics, <i>The Wind in the Willows</i> is also always there, ready to provide us, when we feel lost, with all the comforts of Home. (Maria Tatar <i>Globe and Mail</i> 2009-06-20)<br><br>[A] handsome edition...[Lerer] provides a wealth of information that will be welcomed by anyone who wants return to the riverbank and discover just how enduring and endearing Grahame's masterpiece remains a century after it was published. (Peter Parker <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2009-06-26)<br><br>For all its apparent celebration of neatness and domestic orderliness <i>The Wind in the Willows</i> is really a book about letting go. It begins with Mole, tired of spring cleaning, putting aside his whitewash brush and taking to the road, and its true hero is Toad, who is anarchy incarnate.

It is the long-awaited follow-up to Derek Parfit's 1984 book <em>Reasons and Persons</em>, one of the landmarks of twentieth-century philosophy. In this first volume Parfit presents a powerful new treatment of reasons and rationality, and a critical examination of three systematic moral theories -- Kant's ethics, contractualism, and consequentialism -- leading to his own ground-breaking synthetic conclusion. Along the way he discusses a wide range of moral issues, such as the significance of consent, treating people as a means rather than an end, and free will and responsibility. <em>On What Matters</em> is already the most-discussed work in moral philosophy: its publication is likely to establish it as a modern classic which everyone working on moral philosophy will have to read, and which many others will turn to for stimulation and illumination.<br></p><p><br><strong>Derek Parfit</strong> is one of the leading philosophers of our time.

It was also a time of social and political change, and there are still many unanswered questions: did the Antonines' rule contain the seeds of later decay? How did the Christians fare? Was Commodus as bad as he was made out to be? Michael Grant examines these issues with clarity and skill.<br>The importance of the Antonines is manifold, but it mainly lies in the fact that they represented an `age of transition'. They were playing gigantic parts in the massive historical drama that was unfolding, a drama which was destined to transform the Roman Empire from its ancient mould and bring it into the Middle Ages.<br>Michael Grant is one of the world's greatest writers on ancient history. He has had a distinguished academic career, most recently as Vice-Chancellor of Queen's University, Belfast, and has published over fifty books.</p><p>Michael Grant, one of the few eminent writers on ancient history, most recently has served as the Vice-Chancellor of Queen&#39;s University, Belfast.The distinguished, prolific classical historian (Constantine the Great, p. 681, etc.) here critically examines the reigns of the Roman Empire's three Antonine emperors (a.d. 138192). Eighteenth-century historian Edward Gibbon considered the reigns of Antoninus Pius (a.d. 138161) and Marcus Aurelius (a.d. 161180) the period ``during which the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous.'' Grant looks carefully at this traditional view of the Antonine Pax Romana and points out that during Antoninus Pius's long rule there were disturbances in Greece, Britain, Dacia, Judaea, and Africa; he also criticizes Pius's administration as static, backward-looking, and uncreative, though competent enough. At his death, in a decision that presaged the disastrous power-sharing arrangements of the later empire, Antoninus Pius bequeathed a shared authority to Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus (who died a natural death in a.d. 169). Aurelius, author of the Stoic classic Meditations, ruled successfully during a turbulent period; he had to stave off challenges to Roman rule in Britain and Gaul, fight wars against the Parthians and on the Danube frontier, and govern an empire riven by a grave pestilence. Weakened by ``incessant winter campaigning,'' he died on the Danube frontier in a.d. 180, leaving the empire in the hands of his son, the cruel megalomaniac Commodus (a.d. 180192), whose reign is noteworthy mainly for its absolutism and arbitrary violence. Grant reviews Antonine art, architecture, literature, and rhetoric, arguing that thematically (the rejection even by pagan writers of classical paganism) and in style and form (the works of Apuleius presage the modern novel) Antonine culture marks a transition from the ancient to the early medieval world. With characteristic lucidity, Grant shows that Rome during its vaunted ``golden age'' contained seeds of its future collapse and of the Europe to come. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Reprint.</p><p>In this complex and rewarding novel, Williams (Days of Atonement) has created a future which features many of the wonders SF has been promising us for years: virtual reality, genetic engineering, faster-than-light travel, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, telepathic links with computers, and more. Perhaps most interesting is that people have control of their daimones, different aspects of personality that are given specific names. The class system remains: the aristoi are the seemingly perfect humans who wield power and influence; in fact, some worship them as gods. An aristos named Gabriel discovers a conspiracy among three others of his class, who have created several worlds that are barbaric, with little technology and rampant disease and sickness. They have also killed other aristoi to cover their tracks and violated the sanctity of the Logarchy, the massive, open computer network that links all humans. In a nice touch, Williams renders several scenes in two columns of text on the page, the left describing the action, the right Gabriel's internal dialogue with his daimones. And in one delicious scene Gabriel has sex with two different women at the same time--one in virtual reality, one in real space. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.In the far future, an elite class of individuals--called aristoi--rules an interstellar empire through the benign, disciplined mastery of advanced technologies. Beneath the facade of universal prosperity, however, lurks a tide of dissension and madness that can only be fought from within. Williams ( Voice of the Whirlwind , LJ 5/15/87; Days of Atonement , LJ 3/15/91) tests the borders of imagination in a novel that combines brilliant hard science and speculative vision with a firm grip on the central humanity of his characters.

Despite their rivalry, each came to acknowledge the other as his only true equal: Matisse would eventually say, &#34;Picasso sees everything,&#34; while for Picasso, &#34;All things considered, there is only Matisse.&#34; This book is one of two produced to accompany a major exhibition on the two artists&#39; work. The first book is the exhibition&#39;s 400-page catalogue Matisse Picasso. Looking at Matisse and Picasso is a shorter study, providing a general introduction to the artists and comparing a representative selection of their works. The illustrations have been selected to demonstrate the visual relationships in Matisse&#39;s and Picasso&#39;s art in a clear and dramatic way, and the brief texts, written by members of the staff of the Museum of Modern Art&#39;s Department of Education, vividly illuminate the parallels and resonances in the two men&#39;s lives and work. Matisse and Picasso are polar opposites but also complementary figures. Between them they are the originators of many of the most significant innovations of 20th-century painting and sculpture, but their relationship has rarely been explored in all of its closeness and complexity. In spite of their initial rivalry, the two masters eventually acknowledged one another as equals, becoming, in their old age, increasingly important to one another both artistically and personally. From the time of their initial encounters in 1906 in Gertrude and Leo Stein&#39;s Paris studio until 1917, they individually produced some of the greatest art of the 20th century and maintained an openly competitive relationship brimming with intense innovation. This period saw them create such works as Picasso&#39;s majestic &#34;Woman with a Fan&#34; of 1908 and Matisse&#39;s great portrait of his wife of 1913. Matisse responds to Synthetic Cubism in his &#34;Piano Lesson&#34; of 1916 and Picasso comes back in turn with a new, more decorative Cubism in &#34;Three Musicians&#34; of 1921. The 20s saw them grow apart, as Matisse moved from Paris to Nice and Picasso became involved with the Surrealists, but the 30s brought them together again, through their sheer fame and devotion to reality-based art. Their story continues until Matisse&#39;s death in 1954, when Picasso paid his friend and colleague tribute in his series Women of Algiers, of which he said, &#34;When Matisse died, he left his odalisques to me as a legacy.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Punishment</h2><p><p>Punishment is a topic of increasing importance for citizens and policymakers. Why should we punish criminals? Which theory of punishment is most compelling? Is the death penalty ever justified?

Green, Distinguished Professor of Law and Nathan L.

In the last quarter century, retribution has returned with a vengeance, both in the theoretical literature and (with a very different emphasis) in public policy. The rise of the victim as a player in the criminal justice system has also fuelled a counter-trend, placing an emphasis on redress. Human rights, privatization, globalization, the rise of the therapist, the lobbyist, the terrorist: all have affected our ways of punishing and of thinking about punishment. A new survey of the terrain is overdue. And who better to conduct it than Thom Brooks, whose grasp of the literature and feel for the issues is second to none?

Through simple stories similar to Carol Gray's <i>Social Stories� </i>, author Mary Wrobel teaches caregivers exactly what to say (and not say) and shows how you can create helpful stories of your own. Mary addresses hygiene, modesty, body growth and development, menstruation, touching, personal safety, and more. Young students can benefit from self-care skills such as using the toilet, brushing teeth, and washing hands. Parents and teachers should begin teaching these necessary skills as early as possible, even from ages three to five. The ultimate goal is to maximize the child's potential for independence and lifelong social success.</p></p><p>Mary Wrobel is a speech-language pathologist with more than twenty years&#39; experience of working with students with autism and other developmental disabilities.<p>Mary Wrobel is a speech-language pathologist with more than twenty years of experience working with students who have autism and other disabilities.

Peter Brown&#39;s study examines the factors which proved decisive and the compromises which made the emergence of the Christian &#39;thought world&#39; possible. He shows how contemporary narratives wavered between declarations of definitive victory and a sombre sense of the strength of the pre-Christian past, reflecting the hopes and fears of different generations faced with different social and political situations. He examines the social factors which muted the sharp intolerance which pervades the contemporary literary evidence, and he shows how Christian holy men were less representatives of a triumphant and intransigent faith than negotiators, at ground level, of a working compromise between the new faith and traditional ways of dealing with the supernatural world.</p><p>The Christianisation of the Roman world lies at the root of modern Europe, yet at the time it was a tentative and piecemeal process.

She demonstrates how Pennsylvania--the birthplace of American abolition--remained relevant to the cause.

When originally published in 1994, Walker Evans: The Hungry Eye was the first book to survey every significant aspect of the artist&#39;s oeuvre. This reduced-format version, identical in content to the previous volume, includes 300 beautiful duotone photographs. Evans was largely self-educated and began photographing regularly in 1927, using a small hand-held camera. He specialized in the life of the street - carefully observed views of American architecture, the roadside, and the people who lived in the nation&#39;s villages, towns and cities. Beginning with Evans&#39;s early abstractions, continuing through his three-year involvement with the Farm Security Administration and his breakthrough exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and concluding with the artist&#39;s experimentation with colour late in his life, Walker Evans: The Hungry Eye remains the most complete and authoritative view of this American photographic master.</p><p>Gilles Mora writes widely on photography. He is the author of Walker Evans: The Hungry Eye, also published by Thames &amp; Hudson."In Evans's world, even the inanimate things, bureau drawers, pots, tires, bricks, signs, seem waiting in their own patient dignity, posing for their pictures." --Lincoln Kirstein<br></p><h2>Feast of Excess: A Cultural History of the New Sensibility</h2><p>In 1952, John Cage shocked audiences with 4'33", his compositional ode to the ironic power of silence. From Cage's minimalism to Chris Burden's radical performance art two decades later (in one piece he had himself shot), the post-war American avant-garde shattered the divide between low and high art, between artist and audience. They changed the cultural landscape.<br><br><em>Feast of Excess</em> is an engaging and accessible portrait of "The New Sensibility," as it was named by Susan Sontag in 1965. The New Sensibility sought to push culture in extreme directions: either towards stark minimalism or gaudy maximalism. Through vignette profiles of prominent figures-John Cage, Patricia Highsmith, Allen Ginsberg, Andy Warhol, Anne Sexton, John Coltrane, Bob Dylan, Erica Jong, and Thomas Pynchon, to name a few-George Cotkin presents their bold, headline-grabbing performances and places them within the historical moment.<br><br>This inventive and jaunty narrative captures the excitement of liberation in American culture. The roots of this release, as Cotkin demonstrates, began in the 1950s, boomed in the 1960s, and became the cultural norm by the 1970s. <br><br>More than a detailed immersion in the history of cultural extremism, <em>Feast of Excess</em> raises provocative questions for our present-day culture.<br></p><p><br><strong>George Cotkin </strong>is Emeritus Professor of History at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. His previous books include <em>Existential America</em>, <em>Morality's Muddy Waters</em>, and <em>Dive Deeper: Journeys with Moby-Dick</em>.<br><br>"Michaels's thesis is a brilliantly provocative challenge to the widely accepted view that art's political power derives from its engagement with, rather than its autonomy from, the world."--Timothy Aubry, <em>American Literature</em><p></p><br>"One of our most versatile intellectual and cultural historians...Cotkin deserves applause for structuring <em>Feast of Excess</em> differently from the standard models. The series of year-by-year chronological profiles does, surprisingly, create a sense of a cultural whole...<em>Feast of Excess</em> is a clearly imagined and executed account of the last time American culture seemed headed for a cultural revolution."--<em>Journal of American History</em><p></p><br>"[Cotkin's] writing style makes this work an irresistible read <em>Feast of Excess</em> offers scholars and students a compelling approach to the history of the United States during a period of dynamic cultural change."--<em>The History Teacher</em><p></p><br>"Cotkin offers a whirlwind tour of artists and writers who shaped what has become known, thanks to Susan Sontag, Morris Dickstein, et al., as the new sensibility."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"With great verve, George Cotkin's <em>Feast of Excess</em> demonstrates beyond any doubt that the in-your-face culture of provocation we rightly associate with the 1960s had much deeper roots and a long and varied life. Ranging impressively through all the arts, nicely balanced between anecdote and analysis, this book cuts a wide swath through postwar American culture."--Morris Dickstein, author of <em>Dancing in the Dark</em> and <em>Gates of Eden</em><p></p><br>"<em>Feast of Excess</em> is a tour de force. George Cotkin moves across a vast array of figures who created the New Sensibility, traversing different media like painting, photography, music, performance art, literature, and journalism. Both sympathetic yet critical--neither a curmudgeonly neoconservative nor a blind partisan--Cotkin manages to provide a full picture of what some historians call the long Sixties. This book will serve as the work on the New Sensibility for years to come. And to top it all off, it's a pleasure to read."--Kevin Mattson, author of <em>Just Plain Dick: Richard Nixon's</em> <em>Checkers Speech and the "Rocking, Socking" Election of 1952</em><p></p><br>"George Cotkin brings his signature inventiveness and subtlety to an American cultural period and style that previously lacked a name. <em>Feast of Excess</em> makes vividly real the ragged debauchery and blunt-force iconoclasm of the New Sensibility of extravagance of the 50s, 60s, and 70s. This is an utterly arresting book."--Jennifer Ratner-Rosenhagen, author of <em>American Nietzsche: A History of an Icon and His Ideas</em><p></p><br>"Great stories, provocative ideas, unexpected links - this book is a festival in itself.

It accomplishes this by taking students that have no computer design experience from simple commands to complete projects in this single-semester sized text. This well organized and progressive approach to learning AutoCAD sets this text apart from others. To support all users, this book now covers AutoCAD for both Macs and PCs. </p> <p> The emphasis of this book is on easy to understand descriptions and instructions, allowing the non-technical, artistic, visual learning Interior Design student to quickly get past the fear of using the computer to produce drawings. The focus is entirely on the use of AutoCAD for the Interior Design field and not simply architectural drawings. </p> <p> Chapters alternate between command descriptions, which are organized by a command set category, and tutorials. This allows students to easily refer back to command descriptions without hunting through a tutorial that introduces commands as it progresses. The emphasis is on the practical use of commands using the AutoCAD ribbon workspace, rather than the multiple (and seldom used) command options. </p> <p> Multiple tutorials of the hotel suite, which includes floor plan, elevation views, dimensioning, and plotting, provide a practical application of the commands learned in the preceding chapters. Completely dimensioned drawings are provided at the beginning of each tutorial so that the advanced student, or an instructor led class, can complete them without going through the step-by-step process. </p> <p> This textbook is classroom proven, and relevant interior design homework problems are provided. After completing this book, the student will be able to create all their 2-D Interior Design work using AutoCAD. </p> <p><b>Table of Contents</b></p> 1. Getting Started with AutoCAD <br>2.

More importantly, they?re inexpensive to print, which perhaps explains why two-color printing is so widely used. Despite its popularity, however, two-color printing has a stigma of looking cheap compared to four-color pieces. This book puts that myth to rest by showing how truly dynamic effects can be achieved with simple, inexpensive two-color printing. Besides its simplicity, it has a style all its own, which can convey sophistication, elegance, and integrity. Included is a ?color finder? section designed to show readers a variety of color combinations for various projects such as logos, packaging, book jackets, and posters. Each featured project is shown in thumbnail size in 15 to 20 different two-color combinations.</p><p>Templin Brink Design was launched in 1998 by Joel Templin and Gaby Brink.

He began inventing these stories in his American wife&#39;s hometown of Brattleboro, Vermont, to amuse his eldest daughter--and they have served ever since as a source of laughter for children everywhere.</p><p>How did the camel get his hump? Why won&#39;t cats do as they are told? Who invented reading and writing? How did an inquisitive little elephant change the lives of elephants everywhere? Kipling&#39;s imagined answers to such questions draw on the beast fables he heard as a child in India, as well as on folk games with language, exploring the relationships between thought, speech, and the written word. He also celebrates his own joy in fatherhood. The tales were told to his own and his friends&#39; children over many years before he wrote them down, adding poems and his own illustrations. They invite older and younger readers to share a magical experience, each contributing to the other&#39;s pleasure, but each can also enjoy them alone, as more jokes, subtexts, and exotic references emerge with every reading. This fully illustrated edition includes two extra stories and Kipling&#39;s own explanation of the title.Rudyard Joseph Kipling was born in the then named Bombay, India on 30th December 1865. Aged six, he was sent to England to be educated, firstly in Southsea, where he was cared for in a foster home, and later at Westward Ho, a United Services College in Devon. A life of misery at the former was described in his story 'Baa Baa Black Sheep', whilst Westward Ho was used as a basis for his questioning the public school ethic in 'Stalky and Co'. Kipling returned to India in 1882 to work as an assistant editor for the Civil and Military Gazette of Lahore. His reputation as a writer was established with stories of English life in India, published there in 1888/9. &#x2018;The Phantom Rickshaw&#x2019;, &#x2018;Soldiers Three&#x2019; and &#x2018;Under the Deodars&#x2019; are amongst these early works. Returning to England in 1889, Kipling settled in London and continued to earn a living as a writer. In 1892 he married Caroline Balestier, an American. They travelled extensively in the following four years, including a spell living in America, and it was in this time most of his enduring work was written, not least &#x2018;The Jungle Book&#x2019; and &#x2018;The Second Jungle Book&#x2019;. Kipling once again returned to England in 1896 and continued his writing career, although tragedy hit the family when his eldest daughter, Josephine, died in 1899. Nonetheless, in 1901 he completed &#x2018;Kim&#x2019;, often considered to be his best work. The following year, having settled in Sussex, he published &#x2018;Just So Stories&#x2019;, a book he had planned to write for Josephine. Having refused the position of Poet Laureate, which was offered in 1895, he did accept the Nobel Prize for Literature, becoming the first English author to be so honoured. By 1910, however, Kipling&#x2019;s appeal was waning. His poems and stories were based on values that were perceived as outdated. There was widespread reaction against Victorian imperialism, highlighted by the incompetent management of the Boer War. When World War I came, Kipling had difficulty in adapting to the mood of the public and after his only son, John, was reported missing in action believed killed in 1915, he became very active on the War Graves Commission. After the war he became an increasingly isolated figure, although some of his best writing was to come, with &#x2018;Debits and Credits&#x2019; in 1926 and &#x2018;Limits and Renewals&#x2019; in 1932. Kipling died in 1936 in London and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Today, however, he is once again avidly read not just for the quality of his writing and storytelling, but through a renewed interest in the behaviour and values he represented.</p><h2>Storytelling: Branding in Practice</h2><p>As a concept, storytelling has won a decisive foothold in the debate on how brands of the future will be shaped. Yet, companies are still confused as to how and why storytelling can make a difference to their business. What is the point of telling stories anyway? What makes a good story? And how do you go about telling it so that it supports the company brand? This book is written for practitioners by practitioners. Through real life examples, simple guidelines and practical tools, the book aims to inspire companies to use storytelling as a means of building their brand - internally as well as externally.</p><p>As a business concept &#x201c;storytelling&#x201d; has had a significant impact on how companies can build strong corporate cultures and credible brands. Yet many corporations are still confused as to how exactly storytelling can make a difference: Why should we tell stories at all? What makes a good story? And how do we tell it in a way that advances our company both culturally and fiscally while strengthening our brand? The second edition of this successful book presents ten new case studies. Written by practitioners for practitioners and students and filled with simple tools for putting corporate storytelling into practice, it provides knowledge and inspiration for using storytelling as a strategic tool for releasing your company&#x2019;s potential.Klaus Fog holds a Masters Degree in Business Administration.

Without pretending to be able to foresee future developments, both authors of this book think it improbable that the problem will ever be solved, in the sense that we shall really understand this relation. We think that no more can be expected than to make a little progress here or there. We have written this book in the hope that we have been able to do so. We are conscious of the fact that what we have done is very conjectur� al and very modest. We are aware of our fallibility; yet we believe in the intrinsic value of every human effort to deepen our understanding of our� selves and of the world we live in. We believe in humanism: in human rationality, in human science, and in other human achievements, however fallible they are. We are unimpressed by the recurrent intellectual fashions that belittle science and the other great human achievements. An additional motive for writing this book is that we both feel that the debunking of man has gone far enough - even too far. It is said that we had to learn from Copernicus and Darwin that man&#39;s place in the universe is not so exalted or so exclusive as man once thought. That may well be.</p><p>The relation between body and mind is one of the oldest riddles that has puzzled mankind. That material and mental events may interact is accepted even by the law: our mental capacity to concentrate on the task can be seriously reduced by drugs. Physical and chemical processes may act upon the mind; and when we are writing a difficult letter, our mind acts upon our body and, through a chain of physical events, upon the mind of the recipient of the letter. the authors of this book stress that they cannot solve the body mind problem; but they hope that they have been able to shed new light on it.." . . anyone with an interest in philosophy, science, and the future of the world should read it."<br>-"British Journal of Psychiatry <br>." . . a massive achievement . . . a theory of beautiful simplicity, with all the relevant data clearly set out down to recent research findings."<br>-"The Jerusalem Post <br></p><h2>Community-Based Corrections: A Text/Reader (SAGE Text/Reader Series in Criminology and Criminal Justice)</h2><p><p>Presenting a more practical viewpoint than other texts available for the course, this book offers a unique textbook/reader alternative to the traditional textbook format.

What do they say about the nature of Gregory's writing?

He shows how Christian teaching and practice shaped the worldview of soldiers on both sides: how it motivated them for the struggle, how it influenced the way they fought, and how it shaped national life after the war ended. </p><p>Through the diaries, letters, and reminiscences of common soldiers, Woodworth illuminates religious belief from the home front to the battlefield, where thoughts of death and the afterlife were always close at hand. Woodworth reveals what these men thought about God and what they believed God thought about the war. </p><p>Wrote one Unionist, "I believe our cause to be the cause of liberty and light . . . the cause of God, and holy and justifiable in His sight, and for this reason, I fear not to die in it if need be." With a familiar echo, his Confederate counterpart declared that "our Cause is Just and God is Just and we shall finally be successful whether I live to see the time or not." </p><p>Woodworth focuses on mainstream Protestant beliefs and practices shared by the majority of combatants in order to help us better understand soldiers' motivations and to realize what a strong role religion played in American life throughout the conflict. In addition, he provides sharp insights into the relationship between Christianity and both the abolition movement in the North and the institution of slavery in the South. </p><p>Ultimately, Woodworth shows us how opposing armies could put their trust in the same God while engaging in four years of organized slaughter and destruction. His compelling work provides a rich new perspective on religion in American life and will forever change the way we look at the Civil War. </p><p>This book is part of the <i>Modern War Studies</i> series.</p></p><p>"A genuine contribution to the literature on the world of Civil War soldiers."--James M.

The authors succeed in this through the use of several pedagogical tools (Margin Notes, Chapter Outlines, Summaries, and a nomenclature list) that help students visualize the many difficult-to-understand phenomena of fluid mechanics. Potter and Wiggert base their explanations on basic physical concepts and mathematics which are accessible to undergraduate engineering students, such as differential equations and vector algebra.</p><p>An authoritative, mainstream presentation of the physical concepts and mathematics of fluid mechanics.Key Benefit: This book presents an authoritative, mainstream introduction to the physical concepts and mathematics of fluid mechanics. Key Topics: The book reinforces concepts with equations and solutions for relatively simple geometrics through an abundance of examples, worked problems, and derivations with easy-to-follow steps. Although the book emphasizes SI units, approximately one-quarter of the worked examples and problems are duplicated with English units, and all properties and dimensional constants are provided in both SI and English units. It also includes computer-based Basic and spread sheet solutions in the chapters relating to open channel and pipe network flows. Includes a thorough introduction to environmental fluid mechanics in Chapter 14, where the emphasis is on mass transport in surface water systems that contain turbulent flows. In addition, a section on fluid transients has been added to Chapter 11. Market: A valuable resource book for any practicing engineer seeking further understanding of fluid mechanics as it relates to civil, environmental, mechanical, or general engineering.</p><h2>Facing Death: Epicurus and His Critics</h2><p>The ancient philosophical school of Epicureanism tried to argue that death is "nothing to us." Were they right? James Warren examines the arguments they offered and evaluates their success, setting them against modern philosophical accounts of how death can be a harm. He also asks whether a life free from all fear of death is an attractive option and what the consequences would be of a full acceptance of the Epicureans' views.<br></p><p>James Warren is at Faculty of Classics, University of Cambridge.<br>"This book is what Epicureans and their critics, both hostile and sympathetic, have been waiting for. It is rare, indeed, to find a work that shows both a solid grasp of ancient texts, their proper philological interpretation and appreciation, and is at the same time clearly cognizant of the contemporary philosophical debates on the issues originally raised by our Greek sources. This is such a book and its publication will prove to be a milestone."--<em>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Bioethics and the Human Goods: An Introduction to Natural Law Bioethics</h2><p><i>Bioethics and the Human Goods </i>offers students and general readers a brief introduction to bioethics from a "natural law" philosophical perspective. This perspective, which traces its origins to classical antiquity, has profoundly shaped Western ethics and law and is enjoying an exciting renaissance. While compatible with much in the ethical thought of the great religions, it is grounded in reason, not religion. In contrast to the currently dominant bioethical theories of utilitarianism and principlism, the natural law approach offers an understanding of human flourishing grounded in basic human goods, including life, health, friendship, and knowledge, and in the wrongness of intentionally turning against, or neglecting, these goods. <br><br>The book is divided into two sections: Foundations and Issues. Foundations sketches a natural law understanding of the important ethical principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice and explores different understandings of "personhood" and whether human embryos are persons. Issues applies a natural law perspective to some of the most controversial debates in contemporary bioethics at the beginning and end of life: research on human embryos, abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, the withdrawal of tube-feeding from patients in a "persistent vegetative state," and the definition of death. The text is completed by appendices featuring personal statements by Alfonso G�mez-Lobo on the status of the human embryo and on the definition and determination of death.</p><p><b>Alfonso G�mez-Lobo</b> (d. 2011) held the Ryan Chair in Metaphysics and Moral Philosophy at Georgetown University. He was a leading authority on classical philosophy and on bioethics. He specialized in Greek philosophy and historiography, the history of ethics, contemporary natural law theory, and bioethics. He was the recipient of several awards, including a research fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation, and was a member of the President's Council on Bioethics. His many publications include <i>Morality and the Human Goods</i>.<br><br><b>John Keown</b> holds the Rose F.

His research has been cited by distinguished bodies worldwide, including the US Supreme Court and the Law Lords. In 2015 Oxford University awarded him the degree of DCL, or Doctor of Civil Law, in recognition of his contribution to the field of law and bioethics.<p>"Alfonso G�mez-Lobo was a thinker and writer of uncommon insight and wisdom. His death was a grievous loss not only for philosophy as an academic discipline, but for truth-seeking in the cause of sound public policy on morally charged issues in our public life. Praise to John Keown, therefore, for bringing us Professor G�mez-Lobo's <i>Bioethics and the Human Goods</i>. It will be a valuable resource in our efforts to shape law and public policy in line with central truths about right and wrong."&#x2015;Robert P. George, McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence, Princeton University</p><p>"Alfonso Gomez-Lobo was probably the best representative of natural law ethics that I have had the privilege of knowing. <i>Bioethics and the Human Goods</i> lays out the essential elements of this tradition before engaging a host of issues in bioethics, particularly around the beginning and end of human life. While disagreeing with much of the vision presented here, I cannot help admiring its moral seriousness, intelligence, and coherence."&#x2015;David DeGrazia, author of <i>Human Identity and Bioethics and Creation Ethics: Reproduction, Genetics, and Quality of Life</i>, George Washington University</p></p><h2>The New England Mill Village, 1790-1860</h2><p>The industrial revolution in America did not begin with billows of smoke and steam from city factories but in bucolic settings scattered about the rural landscape where textile manufacturing first took root. As Zachariah Allen writes in 1829, these textile operations were "carried on in little hamlets, which often appear to spring up in the bosom of some forest, around the water fall which serves to turn the mill wheel." When he wrote there were already thousands of company-owned mill villages in the northeast and by 1840 there were nearly 700 cotton mills alone in New England, most of them still in such villages close to rivers and streams.<br> <br> This book documents the growth of industrial technology in these "little hamlets," covering the social, labor, economic, and technical aspects of this fascinating chapter in the development of American enterprise.<br> <br> The sources brought together here include company records; general histories of early cotton manufactures; accounts of particular companies; memoirs, autobiographies, letters, and diary entries of mill founders, managers, and workers; contemporary descriptions of factory villages; data found in ledgers, manufacturing censuses, and employee lists; company regulations; weaving instructions; help-wanted advertisements and recruiting letters for mill workers; workers' contracts; newspaper accounts of labor protests; and maps.<br> <br> Gary Kulik is curator of textile machinery at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.

Montgomery</h2><p>L.M.Montgomery grew up in Prince Edward Island, a real place of "politics and potatoes." But it's her fictional island, a richly textured imaginative landscape that has captivated a world of readers since 1908, when <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> became the first of Montgomery's long string of bestsellers.<br> <br> In this wide-ranging and highly readable book, Elizabeth Waterston uses the term "magic" to suggest that peculiar, indefinable combination of attributes that unpredictably results in creative genius. Montgomery's intelligence, her drive, and her sense of humour are essential components of this success. Waterston also features what Montgomery called her "dream life," a "strange inner life of fancy which had always existed side by side with my outer life." This special ability to look beyond the veil, to access vibrant inner vistas, produced deceptively layered fictions out of a life that saw not just its share of both fame and ill fortune, but also what Waterston calls "dark passions."<br> <br> A true reader's guide, <em>Magic Island</em> explores the world of L.M. Montgomery in a way never done before. Each chapter of <em>Magic Island</em> discusses a different Montgomery book, following their progression chronologically. Waterston draws parallels between Montgomery's internal "island," her personal life, her professional career, and the characters in her novels. Designed to be read alongside the new biography of Montgomery by Mary Rubio, this is the first book to reinterpret Montgomery's writing in light of important new information about her life. A must-read for any Montgomery fan, <em>Magic Island</em> offers a fresh and insightful look at the world of L.M. Montgomery and the "magic" of artistic creation.</p><p><br>Elizabeth Waterston was born in Montreal, and educated at McGill, Bryn Mawr, and University of Toronto. She taught literature at the University of Guelph and the University of Western Ontario for many years, and is now Professor Emeritus at the University of Guelph.<br></p><h2>Mary Austin and the American West</h2><p>Mary Austin (1868-1934)&#x2015;eccentric, independent, and unstoppable&#x2015;was twenty years old when her mother moved the family west. Austin's first look at her new home, glimpsed from California's Tejon Pass, reset the course of her life, &#x201c;changed her horizons and marked the beginning of her understanding, not only about who she was, but where she needed to be.&#x201d; At a time when Frederick Jackson Turner had announced the closing of the frontier, Mary Austin became the voice of the American West. In 1903, she published her first book, <i>The Land of Little Rain,</i> a wholly original look at the West's desert and its ethnically diverse peoples. Defined in a sense by the places she lived, Austin also defined the places themselves, whether Bishop, in the Sierra Nevada, Carmel, with its itinerant community of western writers, or Santa Fe, where she lived the last ten years of her life. By the time of her death in 1934, Austin had published over thirty books and counted as friends the leading literary and artistic lights of her day. <br><br>In this rich new biography, Susan Goodman and Carl Dawson explore Austin's life and achievement with unprecedented resonance, depth, and understanding. By focusing on one extraordinary woman's life, <i>Mary Austin and the American West</i> tells the larger story of the emerging importance of California and the Southwest to the American consciousness.</p><p>"Finally, a book that does Mary Austin justice in all her complexity and takes her seriously as a challenging and varied writer."&#x2015;Melody Graulich, coeditor of <i>Exploring Lost Borders </i><br><br>"A wonderful wide-angle view of an era in the American West and its literary, artistic, and anthropological figures."&#x2015;Robert D.

Imaging is discussed in terms of convolution and transfer functions as well as that of double Fourier transformation, and a variety of image processing techniques are described. Subsequent topics include image reconstruction from projections (medical imaging), focusing chiefly on X-ray computed tomography but with brief sections on emission computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonic computed tomography. A chapter on interferometry starts with Michelson's interferometers and extends to the Fourier interpretation of visibility functions, developing the relationship between correlation, partial coherence, and fringe visibility; applications considered include radio and optical astronomy and Fourier transform spectroscopy.<br>Helpful appendixes cover the application of frequency-domain analysis, convolution and correlation in communications, and maximum entropy data processing.

World War II erupted soon after she was married. Alice and her husband, along with many other Japanese Americans, were forced to leave their homes and report to assembly centers around the country. Undaunted, Alice and her husband learned to make the most of every circumstance, from their stall in the old stockyard in Portland to the decrepit farm in the Oregon desert, with its field of stones. Like a pair of skilled dancers, they sidestepped adversity to land gracefully amid golden opportunity. Together they turned a barren wasteland into a field of endless flowers. Such achievements did not come without effort and sacrifice, though, and Alice often thought her dancing days were long behind her. But as her story testifies, life is full of changes . . .<br> In this striking book, Allen Say introduces readers to the remarkable story of the life of a woman whose perseverance and resilience serve as an inspirational reminder that dreams can be fulfilled, even when least expected.</p><p><p>Allen Say was born in Yokohama, Japan, in 1937. He dreamed of becoming a cartoonist from the age of six, and, at age twelve, apprenticed himself to his favorite cartoonist, Noro Shinpei. For the next four years, Say learned to draw and paint under the direction of Noro, who has remained Say's mentor. Say illustrated his first children's book -- published in 1972 -- in a photo studio between shooting assignments. For years, Say continued writing and illustrating children's books on a part-time basis. But in 1987, while illustrating THE BOY OF THE THREE-YEAR NAP (Caldecott Honor Medal), he recaptured the joy he had known as a boy working in his master's studio. It was then that Say decided to make a full commitment to doing what he loves best: writing and illustrating children's books. Since then, he has written and illustrated many books, including TREE OF CRANES and GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY, winner of the 1994 Caldecott Medal. He is a full-time writer and illustrator living in Portland, Oregon.</p>Grade 3 Up-Life changes drastically for Alice when World War II breaks out. Like many other Japanese Americans living on the West Coast, she and her husband are forced from their home. They choose to work as farm hands rather than be sent to an internment camp. Together, they overcome every indignity and challenge that come their way, and eventually build the largest gladiola bulb farm in the country. Say relates the true story of Alice Sumida in an understated and eloquent style. Alice's childhood love of dancing is deftly woven into the imagery of the text. As in much of his work, the masterful illustrations provide an emotional depth not always evident in the narration. The overall design, resembling a family photo album, accentuates the book as personal history. The detailed portraits and soft colors of the farm give way to drab hues and figures with nondescript features and wide-brimmed hats that hide their eyes and their identities-symbolic of the plight of Japanese Americans during the war. The final pictures of a now elderly Alice depict the spirit and dignity that her life story suggests. Although the book has much to recommend it, it may have more limited appeal than some of Say's earlier works. It is not as personal as <i>Grandfather's Journey</i> (1993) or <i>Tea with Milk</i> (1999, both Houghton). Many young readers may lack the perspective to relate to a tale that spans decades and deals with such complex themes. Still, with proper introduction, this offering will be appreciated by sensitive and sophisticated youngsters.<i>-Heide Piehler, Shorewood Public Library, WI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The book focuses upon often hitherto neglected aspects of the artist&#39;s work.</p><p>Henry Miller once described Marc Chagall as a "poet with the wings of a painter." The pages of <i>Chagall</i> are filled with images that prove the writer's words true. Though Chagall is remembered primarily as a painter, his artistic vision expressed itself in many other forms, including sculpture, mosaics, and the stained glass windows that grace the Art Institute of Chicago as well as synagogues and churches in both Europe and the United States. The volume affords readers glimpses of his profligate work as well as the opportunity to follow Chagall as he moved from his early years in Russia to Paris, the United States, and back to France. During that time, his painting flirted with the various art movements around him--surrealism and fauvism most notably--but his dominant themes remained constant throughout the seven decades that he made art. Chagall's mysticism, his deep religious sentiment, and his playfulness are revealed in the hundreds of full-color images lushly reproduced in this volume. The commentary provided by Chagall scholar and friend Jacob Baal-Teshuva expertly guides readers through the artist's various moods and media and underscores the passion of belief and feeling that informed all of his artwork.Despite a life buffeted by war and revolution, by exile and official condemnation in Russia, Marc Chagall preserved in his work a sense of peace and beauty. This comprehensive and incisive exploration of one of the greatest and most beloved artists of this century brings together the writings of art critics, the reminiscences of family, friends, and colleagues, and Chagall&#39;s own words to create a striking portrait of an artist who delighted the world with his unique brand of creativity. Chagall: A Retrospective traces the artist&#39;s personal and artistic development from his humble beginnings in the Russian town of Vitebsk to his continuing contributions to world art at the time of his death at the age of ninety-seven.</p><h2>Random House Unabridged Dictionary</h2><p>ow newly revised and up to the minute--through the Random House Living Dictionary Project, an immense, online lexicographic database--this comprehensive dictionary includes more than 315,000 entries, 2,400 illustrations, 75,000 example sentences, a 32-page atlas, and 45 boxed charts and tables.

The print dictionary continues its tradition of being very up-to-date, thanks in part to a computerized database that Random House has named its "Living Dictionary Project." According to the publisher, 1,000 new words and meanings have been added to the work since the 1987 printing, with another 1,500 revisions to entries and definitions. New entries include <i>cyberpunk</i>, <i>intifada</i>, <i>in-your-face</i>, <i>karaoke</i>, <i>maquiladora</i>, <i>Norplant</i>, <i>virtual reality</i>, <i>wallyball</i>, and <i>wannabe</i>. Additional definitions include <i>not</i> as indicating a previous statement is untrue, and <i>Teflon</i> meaning "imperviousness to blame or criticism." Biographical entries on Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, V{&nbsp;}aclav Havel, David Souter, and Clarence Thomas have been added. Maps within the work have been updated, as has the atlas in the supplementary material. The book has the same attractive format as the previous printing.</p><p>CD-ROM VERSION. This marks the first time an unabridged American dictionary has been released in this format. Macintosh, DOS, and Windows versions are issued on the same CD-ROM. The Macintosh version requires System 6.0.3 or later, 1 MB of RAM, and at least 1 MB free on the hard drive. The DOS version requires at least a 286-based IBM compatible, 2 MB of RAM, and at least 1 MB free on the hard drive, with a mouse recommended. The Windows version has the same requirements as the DOS version, with Windows version 3.0 or higher. The Board examined the DOS and Windows versions.</p><p>Either version can be invoked while the user is in word processing software by using a "hot key" combination, which brings up the entry for whatever word the cursor is on within the document. The Windows version also may be invoked by double-clicking an icon. The DOS version may be invoked from a DOS prompt, though instructions for doing so are given only in the "readme.txt" file on the CD-ROM. It is not possible to print directly from either version; printing can be done only from a word processor. The words entered in a search are not highlighted within a definition in any way, so the user must look carefully for their occurrence. The illustrations from the print dictionary do not appear in the CD-ROM version.</p><p>The CD-ROM comes with no documentation except instructions on how to install the product, which is easy to do. The user must rely exclusively on onscreen help or various ".txt" files on the CD-ROM.</p><p>DOS VERSION. The dictionary occupies approximately half of the screen. The user may select options on a menu bar at the top of the screen using the mouse or arrow keys. Using Dictionary, the user types in a word and presses ENTER. If the Browse option is invoked, a window opens that scrolls down a word list as each letter is typed in. While in Dictionary, a menu bar at the bottom of the screen offers further options with the use of various function keys, for example, to move to the previous or next word in the dictionary or to copy and paste to a word-processing document. The F2 key serves a hypertext function, allowing one to look up a word within a definition without retyping it. This latter feature is undocumented in the help screens. Entries appear as they do in the printed dictionary, although there is no variation in typeface on the screen. Italicized main entries, for example, appear in regular text with a small square in front of them.</p><p>Search opens a window with three options: Definitions, Wildcard, and Anagram. The first option searches for a word within definitions; Boolean operators can be used. Search accepts a maximum of two logical operators--a fact made evident only in the "readme.txt" file. The Wildcard feature is useful for crossword puzzle-questions. Entering <i>??vera??</i>, for example, retrieves <i>beverage</i>, <i>coverage</i>, <i>coverall</i>, and <i>leverage</i>. The Anagram feature is supposed to retrieve all combinations of a series of letters.</p><p>The History menu displays a list of the words looked up during the session. Options allows several choices, including turning a "match exactly" feature on or off. When it is off, terms typed in the definitions window will be truncated. Typing in <i>youth</i>, for example, will retrieve all definitions that contain <i>youth</i> or <i>youths</i>.</p><p>The Help menu, which is not context-sensitive, offers three choices: Features, which explains some search methods; Glossary, which defines terms such as <i>homographs</i> or <i>phrasal verb</i>; and Pronunciation, which supplies a list of pronunciation symbols used.</p><p>WINDOWS VERSION. As is expected, this version has a more graphic interface, though with the same search functions as the DOS version. A menu bar at the top of the screen offers the choices of Lookup? (essentially the same as Dictionary in the DOS version), Edit (for copying and pasting to a word processor), Search, Options, and Help. In addition, a button panel to the right of the screen features the choices of Lookup, Browse, Wildcard, History, Definition Search, and Anagram. The entries themselves are much more eye-pleasing in this version, appearing much as they do in the printed work, with variant typefaces and font sizes. Although still not context-sensitive, the help screens in the Windows version offer many more examples.</p><p>EVALUATION. Unfortunately, this CD-ROM dictionary is plagued by discrepancies in indexing of definitions, misspellings or inaccuracies in the Dictionary lookup feature, an almost useless Anagram search feature, and inconsistencies between the two versions.</p><p>Nowhere is it explicitly stated which parts of an entry may be retrieved when doing a Definitions search. Etymologies appear to be not searchable, nor are the approximate dates when the word entered the English language. There are inconsistencies in retrieving words that appear as synonyms at the end of entries. A Definitions search on <i>gainsay</i> and <i>impugn</i>--both of which appear as synonyms for <i>contradict</i>--successfully retrieves <i>contradict</i>; a search for the word <i>iconoclasm</i>, however, does not retrieve <i>heresy</i>, for which it is a synonym. Usage labels are likewise inconsistently retrieved. A Definitions search on the label vulgar retrieves enough entries to keep prurient searchers entertained for quite awhile. It does not, however, retrieve <i>fuck</i>, though that word is labeled vulgar. Derived words are not retrieved in a Definitions search. Thus, a user will not find <i>panegyrical</i>, which is given as a derivation of <i>panegyric</i>. Plurals are likewise not retrieved, unless they are used within the definition itself.</p><p>A simple word lookup in the Dictionary option in DOS or the Lookup option in Windows revealed inconsistencies. Some words appear twice--once with a period after them. Thus, there is <i>green fee</i> and <i>green fee.</i> on the browse list, each leading to slightly different entries. The word <i>mother</i> is consistently misspelled in the browse list: <i>mothbr</i>, <i>mothbr earth</i>, <i>Mothbr Goose</i>, and so on, although when one retrieves the entry, the main entry itself is properly spelled.</p><p>Such mistakes affect all other search functions. Entering <i>??la?ious</i> in the Wildcard menu, for example, retrieves <i>malarious</i> and <i>salacious</i>, but not <i>hilarious</i>. The reason is that <i>hilarious</i> does not appear in the index. In the DOS version, there are five listings for <i>hilar</i>. Retrieving the first one leads to the entry <i>hilum</i>, the next three lead to identical entries for <i>hilarious</i>, the last to <i>hilarity</i>. In the Windows version, the same list appears, with all five leading to the same entry, <i>hilum</i>, revealing a disparity between the DOS and Windows versions of the database. A Definitions search for <i>conspiracy</i> in the DOS version retrieves 21 hits; a search in the Windows version for the same word retrieves 9 hits--two of which are not retrieved in the DOS version.</p><p>The Anagram search is particularly bug-laden. A search on <i>nails</i>--specifically mentioned in Random House promotional material--retrieves nothing, since the plural <i>nails</i> is not a main entry. An Anagram search on <i>nation</i> retrieves <i>option</i>; one on <i>under</i> retrieves <i>Taino</i> and <i>-tonia</i>. Searching <i>glean</i> retrieves 10 relevant hits, including <i>angel</i>. Searching <i>angel</i>, however, retrieves only 5 hits, not including <i>glean</i>.</p><p>The Boolean-search capability is a nice feature, though it is extremely slow. While useful for questions such as determining what a group of lions is called (entering "<i>group</i> AND <i>lions</i>" retrieves <i>pride</i>), there is no proximity operator, so irrelevant hits will be retrieved. Searching for "<i>french</i> AND <i>cut</i>" took 5 minutes and 15 seconds, despite the fact that a 486/5X-based computer with a double-speed CD-ROM drive was used.</p><p>CONCLUSION. Until such inconsistencies are resolved, the Board cannot recommend the CD-ROM version of the <i>Random House Unabridged Dictionary</i>. Although the Wildcard and Definitions searches are certainly useful, the differences between the same searches in the Windows and DOS versions as well as the many errors spotted make one wonder what was not retrieved due to spelling and indexing inconsistencies. A product with this many features also needs better documentation. The revision of the print dictionary, however, is strongly recommended, particularly for those libraries that did not purchase the second edition. <i></i></p></p><h2>Logging and Pulpwood Production, 2nd Edition</h2><p>Designed to work effectively both as a manual for the logging industry and as a textbook for timber harvesting courses.
